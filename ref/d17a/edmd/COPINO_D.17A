0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container pre-
       notification message (COPINO) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message by which an inland carrier notifies of the delivery or
       pick-up of containers.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified in a
       separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container pre-notification message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Inland carrier
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Container depot, Inland terminal, Container freight station,
       Container terminal, Carrier's agent, Forwarder, Shipper, Consignee
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Container pre-
       notification message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination
       of the following message top level data elements:
       -   operating inland carrier, coded (TDT)
       -   mode of transport (TDT)
       -   inland voyage number/indication (TDT)
       
       *   The container announcement reference (being the release order
       reference or acceptance order reference), in combination with:
       - the Ordering customer, coded,
       - the Agent of the ordering customer
       can be used to refer to information in the Container announcement
       message.
       
       *   An extraction of this message can be sent to the Ordering
       customer (agent) of the Container announcement, e.g. Shipping agent,
       Logistic center and Freight forwarder, for their information. The
       Container pre-notification will be split up in as many messages as
       there are different Ordering customers (agent) of the Container
       announcement message.
       
       *   A message is to be set up for each road conveyance, track (rail)
       or call (inland waterways) of a means of inland transport.
       
       The expected arrival date and time can be given once (on message top
       level) for the means of transport as a whole.
       
       *   One message may contain several containers.
       
       *   For each container its size and type can be specified, including
       prefix and number if known.
       
       *   If the container prefix and number is unknown, a supplementary
       container reference (Container sequence number) is used to identify
       a container (group) in the message.
       
       *   An indicator for the transport status (i.e. export, import,
       transhipment or continental) is to be completed on container level
       (EQD-segment).
       
       *   Main transport details can be specified for each individual
       container. (Note: The inland transport is on message level in the
       COPINO as the inland transport means is being pre-notified to arrive
       to either pick-up or deliver containers for or from different main-
       carriages.)
       
       *   The final place of positioning can be included in case of
       routing via an inland terminal or several container freight stations
       (for stacking purposes).
       
       *   The temperature and dangerous goods information can be specified
       for each goods item which can be related to the corresponding
       containers by linking the goods item group (GID) to the container
       details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP segment.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
