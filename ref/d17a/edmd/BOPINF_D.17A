0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Balance of payment
       information from customer message (BOPINF) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Balance of payment information from customer message is sent
       from a customer to the customer's bank in order to inform the
       customer's bank of information relating to one or more external
       payments which have been received in settlement of transactions with
       non-residents and which must be reported on by the bank to the
       responsible authority for Balance of Payment reporting purposes.

1.2    Field of application

       The Balance of payment information from customer message may be used
       for both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       In some countries the receipt of an external payment by a customer
       has to be reported to the authority responsible for the compilation
       of Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics via the customer's resident
       bank.
       
       It is assumed that the customer has previously been informed of the
       external payment receipt by means of a credit advice (CREADV)
       message sent by the customer's bank. This means that the customer
       need only report in the BOPINF message any required Balance of
       Payment information relating to the transaction which was not
       contained in the credit advice message as long as a reference to the
       received credit advice message is included. The main function of the
       BOPINF message therefore is to provide additional Balance of Payment
       information related to the external payment and which is unknown by
       the customer's bank.
       
       For onwards periodic reporting to the authority responsible for the
       compilation of Balance of Payments statistics the customer's bank
       has to combine the contents of any referenced CREADV messages with
       the related BOPINF messages in order to prepare the Balance of
       payment customer transaction report message (BOPCUS).
       
       The message has been designed with a main detail loop each
       repetition of which should be used to provide information related to
       a single credit advice.
