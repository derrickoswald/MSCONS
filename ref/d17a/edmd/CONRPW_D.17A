0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Response of
       pending works message (CONRPW) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       The construction industry uses this message during its design,
       building and maintenance stages. It communicates with organisations
       about existing and planned services in the vicinity of the works.

1.1    Functional definition

       This message is a reply to a CONAPW message and enables service
       providers to respond to a contractor giving details of any services
       and networks in the location where construction work is to be
       undertaken.

1.2    Field of application

       The Response of pending works message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The parties involved in such transfers belong to various industry
       sectors :
       
       - the construction industry : contractors are the recipients of the
       message.
       
       - gas, electricity, ... and more generally network distributors who
       are among the senders of such messages, and who will process them to
       advise contractors of the presence of existing networks.
       
       - public authorities, which may be
       - clients or designers of projects
       - in charge of specific responsibilities eventually affected by the
       projects.
       
       - in some cases, this type of response on a formal advice may have a
       legal status, the consequence of it may be the liability of the
       sender or receiver. Some insurance companies also may be concerned
       by this message.

1.3    Principles

       This is only one of a group of messages being designed for this flow
       among construction industry. Many aspects have to be considered,
       they are described in the following paragraphs.
       
       This message is the response to a prior request of information,
       which has eventually been sent through another appropriate EDI
       message.
       
       The type of the information to convey in the "flow" CONRPW is not
       only alphanumeric, but some geographical and graphical information
       may be conveyed in conjunction with the response itself, in order
       that the recipient gets all the relevant elements on the existing
       networks. There is another appropriate EDI message being designed to
       convey information on plans and drawing organization, and it has
       been decided not to put this information in the message CONRPW
       itself, but to give an opportunity to link CONRPW with the drawing
       organization message.
