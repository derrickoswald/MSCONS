0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Product data
       message (PRODAT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to submit master data - a set of data that is rarely
       changed - to identify and describe products a supplier offers to his
       (potential) customer or buyer. This information of long validity
       includes technical and functional product description but not
       commercial terms and conditions. This message can be used as well to
       update the information on a previously sent PRODAT message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Product data message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message provides product identification and description on the
       full or partial range of deliverable goods a supplier offers to his
       customers. It might be offered to a single customer, a multitude of
       customers and to agents as well.
       
       The information enables customers to select goods according to
       appropriate needs. To achieve this the subsequent details may be
       provided on specified goods:
       
       + products characteristics
       + technical data
       + utilisation description
       + utilisation requirements
       + handling information
       
       The information may be provided either structured or in free format.
       
       This message provides capability to identify technical information
       being mandatory for ordering.
       Descriptive and, or identifying parts of this message can be copied
       into orders as required.

       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates and/or times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'
       or 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that
       there is a functional requirement for an alternative format.
       
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the date or time or period format
       (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment
       of the group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
