0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Cargo insurance
       claims message (IFTICL) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This paper provides the definition of the Cargo insurance claims
       message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading
       partners in the transport chain world-wide, in the interchange of
       cargo and transport related information using Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI).
       The message is for a single consignment and can be used by all modes
       of transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any
       origin to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing
       commercial practice.
       This message is exchanged between transport industry participants,
       insurers, insurance intermediaries, surveyors and loss adjusters.
       The message conveys single consignment cargo insurance related
       information, such as details of one single loss, claim or survey and
       the parties involved.

1.2    Field of application

       The Cargo insurance claims message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message is designed to give enough information to enable the
       insurer and/or insurance intermediary to start and/or continue the
       claim agreement process. It is not designed for claim payment as
       there are other messages for this purpose.
       
       - The message conveys information about one single loss, damage,
       claim, or survey related to one single consignment. Its content
       could be based on information from the messages IFTMAN or IFTSTA.
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       - Goods items may or may not be containerised.
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a
       single container may contain one or more goods items.
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in
       one or more containers.
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order
       transport for one or more goods items.
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination
       haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or
       instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified
       with its own transport details group.
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it,
       e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on
       another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to
       or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a
       container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on
       their own, are specified in the transport details group.
       Other load or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up
       to three levels.

       Section 2.

3.2    Message terms and definitions

       A number of generic transport terms are used in this specification,
       to be described as:
       
       * Mode of transport: The method of transport used for the conveyance
       of goods or persons, e.g. by rail, by road, by sea.

       pallet).
       
        * Type of equipment: The type of material used, e.g. 40 feet
