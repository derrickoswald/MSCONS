0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Sales data report
       message (SLSRPT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to enable the conveyance of product activity related to
       the sale of products or services, such as the activity location,
       date, time or period, quantity, pricing, monetary amount, market
       sector, involved parties and other data enabling various sales
       analysis processes. Such activity information allows the recipient
       to perform statistical and quantitative analysis in support of
       production, planning, marketing, replenishment, and other processes.

1.2    Field of application

       The Sales data report message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message provides product activity related to the sale of
       products or services in two mutually exclusive methods. These two
       methods are represented by segment groups 5 and 10 within the detail
       area.
       - The first method is reporting activity by line item within a
       specific location, e.g. reporting each product sold within a
       specific location. This method will utilise segment group 5 and its
       subordinate groups. If segment group 5 is used segment group 10
       shall not be used.
       - The second method is reporting activity by location within each
       line item, e.g. reporting each location and quantity sold for a
       particular product. This method will utilise segment group 10 and
       its subordinate groups. If segment group 10 is used segment group 5
       shall not be used.
       
       The message may be sent from a buyer, seller, distributor, public
       warehouse or third party to their supplier, distributor,
       manufacturer, or other third party. It is assumed the recipient will
       perform analytical processing of the data in support of other
       business processes such as marketing, replenishment, or product
       development.
       
       This message provides the recipient with detailed information
       relative to a specific product such as: 
       
       - Location of the activity, e.g. sale or product movement.
       - Specific parties involved, e.g. name of company sold to.
       - Date or period of the activity.
       - Activity price, e.g. selling price.
       - Activity quantity, e.g. quantity sold.
       - Promotion in effect.
       - Value of the sales.
       - Periodical turnover.
       - Additional product information, e.g. product groups or id numbers.
       - Identification of market segment or channel of distribution.
       - Summarisation of information for various locations, e.g. sales for
       all locations in a region.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       Due to the high volume of data that will be usually transmitted in
       the Sales Data Report message, it is highly recommended to use codes
       for products and locations.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.

       Information to be provided in the Header section:

        Data element  0065 SLSRPT
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A

           recommended that where possible only the coded form of the party
           ID should be specified e.g. the sender and receiver of the
           report are known to each other, thus only the coded ID is
           required, but when a new address might have to be clearly
