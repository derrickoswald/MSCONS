0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Multiple debit
       advice message (DEBMUL) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A DEBMUL message is sent by an Account Servicing Financial
       Institution to the Account Owner or to a third party, which has
       agreed bilaterally in advance, that its account (s) has been or will
       be debited for specified amount (s) on the date (s) indicated, in
       settlement of the referenced business transaction (s).

1.2    Field of application

       The Multiple debit advice message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A DEBMUL may cover the financial settlement of one or more
       commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit notes, debit
       notes, etc. It is not intended for use in securities trading.
       
       - Several debit accounts, value dates, entry dates and currencies
       may be specified.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles apply to the message and are
       intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the
       message:
       
       The Multiple Debit Advice message is structured in three levels: A,
       B and C.
       
       - Level A Segment Groups 1,2,3 and 28 contains general data related
       to the whole message.
       
       - Level B Segment groups 4 to 9 is based on the following rules:
         Level B contains data which applies to all the dependent C levels,
       such as,
       
         Same area Code:
       When the BUS segment is used, domestic and international items
       should not be mixed in the same sequence of B and C levels.
       
         Same currency and same account:
         The items to be grouped must refer to the same account. The
       currency to be booked must be the same as that of the account.
       
         Same value date:
         The items must have the same value date.
       
         Same entry date:
         The items must be booked on the same day.
       
         Same bank operation code:
         The items must bear the same bank operation code.
       
         Remark: If, for the same receiver, one of these 5 basic pieces of
       information changes, a new level B is required.
       
       - Level C Segment groups 10 to 27 contains the individual
       transactions, which are related to the data stored on level B.
       
       - The structure of the message is designed to allow several B and C
       levels, each level B being followed by one or several C levels.
       
       - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
