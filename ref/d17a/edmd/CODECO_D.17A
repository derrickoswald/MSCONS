General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container gate-
       in/gate-out report message (CODECO) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message by which a terminal, depot, etc. confirms that the
       containers specified have been delivered or picked up by the inland
       carrier (road, rail or barge). This message can also be used to
       report internal terminal container movements (excluding loading and
       discharging the vessel) and to report the change in status of
       container(s) without those containers having physically been moved.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange. The business
       scenario for the container messages is clarified in a separate
       document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container gate-in/gate-out report message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment.
       
       Sending functions include:
       Container depot, Inland terminal, Container freight station
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic center, Shipper (copy), Freight forwarder
       (copy) and Inland carrier (copy)
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Container gate-
       in/gate-out report message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination
       of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer, coded (NAD)
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD)
       - container announcement reference (being the release order
       reference number or the acceptance order reference number) (RFF)
       
       The ordering customer agent, coded is needed to supplement the
       unique identification only in the next situation: the agent acts on
       behalf of several ordering customers issuing the same range of
       reference numbers for each customer.
       E.g. the ship's agent acts on behalf of several shipping lines
       issuing for each shipping line the same range of numbers.
       
       *   A copy of this message may be sent e.g. to the shipper, freight
       forwarder, the inland waterways and rail carriers, according to the
       communication addresses as mentioned in the Container announcement.
       
       *   One message may contain several containers.
       
       *   A supplementary container reference (container sequence number)
       is used to refer to the information of the container(s) in the
       Container announcement, if the container prefix and number was not
       completed in that message.
       
       *   An indicator for the transport status (i.e. export, import,
       transhipment or continental) is to be completed on container level
       (EQD-segment).
       
       *   One shipping line can be specified on message level.
       
       *   The seagoing vessel and sea voyage number can be specified on
       message level.
       
       *   Inland transport details can be specified for each individual
       container.
       
       *   For each container its place of discharge or its position of
       loading (stowage cell) in/on the means of inland transport can be
       specified.
       
       *   In case of export the port of discharge and any port of
       transhipment can be specified for each individual container.
       
       *   The date/time of pick-up and final address of positioning or the
       date/time of delivery must be given for each container.
       
       *   For each container seals can be specified affixed by the
       shipper, container freight station, terminal, sea carrier and
       Customs.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
