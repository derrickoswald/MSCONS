0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       stuffing/stripping confirmation message (COSTCO) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved
       in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Confirmation that specified goods/consignments have been stuffed
       into or stripped from LCL-containers.
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified in a
       separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container stuffing/stripping confirmation message may be used
       for both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Container freight station
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic center
       
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Container
       stuffing/stripping confirmation message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination
       of the following data elements:
       -  Carrier agent, coded (Shipping agent) (NAD)
       -  Carrier, coded (Shipping line) (TDT)
       -  Stuffing/stripping order reference number (RFF)
       
       *   One message may contain several containers.
       
       *   One shipping line and one shipping agent can be specified on
       message top level.
       
       *   The sea booking reference can be given for each individual LCL-
       consignment (Less than Full Container Load).
       
       *   For each container details can be specified such as container
       prefix and number, size and/or type, seals and off-dimensions
       details.
       
       *   Each LCL-consignment can be identified by means of a booking
       reference and the original shipper, and may consist of several LCL
       goods items.
       
       *   For each LCL goods item details can be specified, such as goods
       description, gross weight, volume, marks and numbers, number and
       kind of packages, any dangerous goods specifications and Customs and
       non-Customs documents.
       
       *   Goods item information can be related to the corresponding
       containers by linking the goods item group (GID) to the container
       details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP segment.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
