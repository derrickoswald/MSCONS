0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Verified gross
       mass message (VERMAS) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       The Verified gross mass message may be used for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal commercial practice
       and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.1    Functional definition

       VERMAS can be used by different parties at different times in a
       transport chain.
       It is not dedicated to a particular process step.
              
       For example, in relation to a supply chain including the transport
       of a packed container on an ocean vessel, the Verified gross mass
       message (VERMAS) permits to submit the verified gross mass of the
       packed container and supporting information as legally required by
       the SOLAS Convention Chapter VI, Part A, Regulation 2.

1.2    Field of application

       The Verified gross mass message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       VERMAS incorporates information on the verified gross mass (VGM) of
       a packed piece of transport equipment such as a seagoing container,
       the time, place and method of obtaining the VGM, the responsible
       parties, and references required by the receiver to assign the VGM
       to his transactions.
       
       The message is used to transmit information related to one or many
       pieces of transport equipment belonging to a clearly defined
       transport movement.
       
       The message can be exchanged between any two parties in the
       transport chain as per mutual agreement. The sender may have
       obtained the verified gross mass himself or he may forward a VGM
       received from a third party. Each party in the transport chain can
       be a sender or a receiver of a VERMAS message.
       
       The only mandatory information in the message refers to the
       transport equipment and to the VGM value. All other information is
       optional and its transmission depends on the role of sender and
       receiver in the transport chain. It is essential that sender and
       receiver agree on the information and references to be exchanged.
       
       The message shall not be used as a handling order.
       
       The message shall not be used for reporting of empty containers.
       
       Dependent on the nature of cargo further attributes such as
       temperature control, identification of dangerous goods, non-standard
       dimensions, handling requirements may also be sent.
