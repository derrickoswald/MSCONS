0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Tax control
       message (TAXCON) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Tax control message is used to enable the transmission of summary
       and control data for tax purposes. It is used to summarise and
       control the taxes (e.g. VAT) or duty which applies to a batch or
       batches of related messages.

1.2    Field of application

       The Tax control message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message meets control needs imposed by administrations and can
       be used by individual users for their own control purposes.
       
       The summary and control information is sent by the sender of tax
       related messages so the recipient may:
       
       a) verify the integrity of the transmission, i.e. of the tax related
       messages sent.
       
       b) maintain an archive of summary and control data of the tax
       related messages for audit purposes.
