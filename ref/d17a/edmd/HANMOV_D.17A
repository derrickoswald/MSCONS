0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Cargo/goods
       handling and movement message (HANMOV) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       The Cargo/goods handling and movement message may be used both for
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.1    Functional definition

       This message includes two functionalities :
       
       - a message from a party to a warehouse/distribution centre
       identifying the handling services and where required the movement of
       specified goods.
       
       - a message from a logistic service provider (i.e. warehouse,
       logistic center, distribution center) to an ordering party reporting
       the handling services status and where required the movement of
       specified goods.
       
       Both are limited to warehouses within the jurisdiction of the
       distribution centre.

1.2    Field of application

       The Cargo/goods handling and movement message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message addresses the indirect flow of goods between seller and
       buyer through a warehouse/distribution center and the report related
       to  this indirect flow.
       
       The functions of this message are limited to:
       
       - assembly/disassembly of goods and products, without interfering in
       the manufacturing process 
       - (re-)packing/unpacking
       - control of goods associated with the handling services but not
       interfering in the manufacturing process
       - marking and labelling on the packages of the goods but does not
       extend to the marking and labelling of the products 
       - movement of goods limited between warehouses within the
       jurisdiction of the distribution center 
       - preparation of goods for shipment
       - storage 
       - clearance
       - goods inspection
       - hazardous material handling
       - status reporting
       
       The status message may be sent: 
       
       - as the result of request(s) for consignment(s) or equipment
       status(es)
       - on a scheduled basis at predetermined times
       - on the occurrence of a selected event(s)
       - on the occurrence of an exceptional event as agreed by the
       partners involved.
       
       The movement of specified goods relates here to the area where
       control of the goods is to be exercised from the arrival of the
       goods to the distribution center until the departure of the goods
       from the distribution center to another party. 
       
       It can include movements between warehouses within the jurisdiction
       of the distribution center. Other movements of goods will be given
       by the relevant instruction messages, i.e. IFTMIN (Instruction
       message) and Instruction For Despatch (message under development).
       
       The functions Assembly/Disassembly are meant to make the goods ready
       for delivery to the final customer, they are not part of the actual
       manufacturing or assembly process.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerised.
       - A goods item may be in one or pieces of equipment, and a single
       equipment may contain one or more goods items.
       - One goods item and/or line item may be related to one or more
       customs tariff codes.
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a
       temperature control unit attached to a container.
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to another load or
       transport device, which as such may be attached to yet another load
       or transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a railway
       wagon.
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on
       their own, are specified in the transport details group. Other load
       or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       - The expression of packaging for goods items in the GID segment can
       be expressed at up to three levels.
