0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Data maintenance
       status report/query message (DMSTAT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Data maintenance status report/query message (DMSTAT) permits
       the transfer of status for any Data Maintenance Request (DMR) action
       among parties involved in the preparation, processing, assessment,
       resolution and directory production processes. The message may also
       be used to inquire as to the current status of a DMR.

1.2    Field of application

       The Data maintenance status report/query message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message permits the submission of a request for status and the
       transmission of status(es) for any DMR action.
       
       The message uses a hierarchical level structure to permit
       flexibility in expanding the description opportunities for status
       report or query types and data content. 
       
       One occurrence of a DMSTAT message may contain:
       
       - status(es) for one or more DMRs,
       - or request the status(es) for a DMR(s),
       - or assign cross-reference numbers for individual DMRs,
       - or send a secretarial status report.
       
       However, only one function (e.g., either a status report, or a
       query, or a notification of log numbers) shall be contained within a
       single message occurrence.
       
       The message may be exchanged at the regional or national level
       between the DMR submitter and the secretariat that acts as the entry
       point for DMR submissions to the submitter's technical assessment
       group. It may also be exchanged at an international level among the
       secretariats for the assessment function as well as those
       participating in the production of the directories.
       
       On a regional or national level the first status sent for a given
       DMR will be from the entry point secretariat to the submitter
       providing the entry point secretariats log number assigned to an
       individual DMR. On an international level the first status sent for
       a given DMR will be from the central secretariat to the submitting
       region providing the UN Log Number assigned for an entry point log
       number.
       
       Where entry point assessment groups review DMRs submitted outside
       their region or nation, the assessment groups will send a status
       report to the central secretariat indicating the status assigned to
       those DMRs. As an entry point assessment group or international
       assessment group reports its status for a DMR, the secretariat will
       include the reference of the assessment group status report from
       which the status is being reported. Each time the central
       secretariat receives a status report from a DMR entry point they
       assign a central secretariat cross-reference to the report and send
       the central secretariat report number back to the entry point's
       secretariat. The central secretariat will assign the report number
       for international assessment group status reports as well as
       consolidated reports for international assessment and directory
       production.
       
       Prior to an international technical assessment or directory
       production meeting the central secretariat will compile the received
       statuses and generate a summary report of DMRs (using the report
       function of DMSTAT) for inclusion in those meetings. The entry point
       secretariats are to confirm the inclusion or removal of DMRs from
       that entry point and, where necessary, confirm the status attributed
       to their assessment group for DMRs issued from other entry points,
       back to the central secretariat (using the status function of
       DMSTAT).
       
       Use of the default service characters is required and the
       Interchange header shall specify character set level C.

        report or query.

00050      PNA, Party identification
           A segment identifying the originator of the message, e.g., the
           DMR submitter, entry point secretariat, central secretariat,
           etc. One iteration must identify the sender's organization name
           and assessment group identification.

00060      COM, Communication contact
           A segment identifying the communication number associated with

4.1.2  Detail section

       Information to be provided in the Detail section:


00070   Segment group 2:  HYN-RFF-SG3-SG4
        A group of segments identifying the type of report or query being
        conveyed, applicable log numbers, applicable cross referencing log
        numbers, actual DMR status, and text comments associated with the
        DMR status.

00080      HYN, Hierarchy information
           A segment used to relate individual iterations of the detail
           section to a particular level in the status report or query.
           
           A query type may either be an entry point query (e.g., an
           inquiry from a submitter to the entry point secretariat) or a
           DMR query (e.g., an inquiry initiated at any other point in the
           activity model).
           
           A report type may either be an entry point status (e.g.,
           provided as status from the entry point) or a DMR status (e.g.,
           DMR status provided at any point in the DMR process).
           
           The notification of log number assignments is sent by entry
           point and central secretariats to respond to the receipt of DMRs
           or regional status reports.

00090      RFF, Reference
           A segment identifying the type of and specific log numbers
           associated with the DMR or status report.
           
           For each DMR status one occurrence of the segment shall be used
           for the status log number associated with the DMR, within a
           particular status report. This number will uniquely identify the
           status provided at each point in the DMR life cycle.
           
           Another occurrence, if required, may be used for the latest log
           number assigned. The sequence of log number assignments shall be
           the originator's internal control log number, entry point
           assigned log number, central secretariat assigned log number,
           and international assessment assigned log number.
           
           One occurrence, if required, may be used to identify the number
           to which the latest log number should be cross-referenced. For
           example, the entry point log number will be cross-referenced to
           the originator's internal control log number, the central
           secretariat assigned log number will be cross-referenced to the
           entry point log number, the central secretariat report number
           will be cross-referenced to the entry point report number, etc.
