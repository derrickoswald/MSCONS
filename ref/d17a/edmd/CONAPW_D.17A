0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Advice on pending
       works message (CONAPW) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       The construction industry uses this message during its design,
       building and maintenance stages. It communicates with organisations
       about existing and planned services in the vicinity of the works.

1.1    Functional definition

       Typically, this message is to enable a contractor who intends to
       start works to advise public authorities and water, gas, telephone,
       electricity ... distributors of his intention and to request them to
       send back plans or information under any form concerning existing
       networks.

1.2    Field of application

       The Advice on pending works message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The parties involved in such transfers belong to various industry
       sectors : 
       
       - the construction industry: contractors are often the originating
       parties of the message.
              
       - gas, electricity, ... and more generally network distributors who
       are among the recipients of such messages, and who will process them
       to check whether they operate networks in an area concerned by
       works.
              
       - public authorities, which may be 
                - clients or designers of projects 
                - in charge of specific responsibilities eventually
                  affected by the projects.
              
       - in some cases, this type of advice may contain a legal status, the
       consequence of it may be the liability of the sender or receiver.
       Some insurance companies also may be concerned by this message.
              
       Within the construction industry, there are numerous rules which
       govern this part of the process. Although, efforts have been made to
       keep the design of the message generic, other potential users of
       this message are cautioned about the specific and original role for
       which this message has been designed.

1.3    Principles

       This is only one of a group of messages being designed for this flow
       among construction industry. Many aspects have to be considered,
       they are described in the following paragraphs.
       "Sending" process of the message : the message is originated by one
       party, but is sent to numerous recipients (from 10 to 20). This is
       the reason why an opportunity is given to use this message in
       conjunction with an appropriate service message which enables the
       sender to indicate to a VAN operator that a considered message has
       to be distributed to more than one receiver.
       This message contains a request for information, to be provided back
       in another appropriate EDI message. The type of the information to
       convey in the "flow" CONAPW is not only alphanumeric, but some
       geographical and graphical information may be conveyed in
       conjunction with the advice itself, in order that the recipient gets
       all the relevant elements on the pending works. There is another
       appropriate EDI message being designed to convey information on
       plans and drawing organization, and it has been decided not to put
       this information in the message CONAPW itself, but to give an
       opportunity to link CONAPW with the drawing organization message.
       In addition, some recipients are interested in receiving the list of
       the other recipients. For the reason that this is not systematic,
       and in order to keep the design of the message as simple as
       possible, it has been decided to use an other appropriate service
       message providing a circulation list, and to give an opportunity to
       link CONAPW with this circulation message.
