General Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Life reinsurance
       activity message (LREACT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The LREACT message is used by companies to exchange insured and
       policy coverage detail for reinsurance purposes. The message will be
       used for both ceded and assumed reinsurance.
                 
       The trading partners utilizing the Life reinsurance activity message
       will be direct companies, reinsurance companies, reinsurance
       intermediaries and retrocessionaires. The message will be used to
       transmit data required by ceding and assuming companies to maintain
       the records on reinsured cessions. This data supports the
       reinsurer's ability to appropriately account for, manage, study,
       value (reserve) and complete their financial reporting. It also
       facilitates the reconciliation of the reinsurance records in order
       to maintain the integrity of the data between the trading partners.

1.2    Field of application

       The Life reinsurance activity message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - The Life reinsurance activity message contains information about
       reinsured individual life insurance policies, reinsured disability
       insurance policies and reinsured annuity contracts administered
       under the terms and conditions of a treaty.
          
       - This message provides the reinsurance information about the base
       policy, the insureds and the coverages of a single policy or group
       of policies.
          
       - This message is only used to communicate information of policies
       from the time of reinsurance issue to the time of reinsurance
       termination.
          
       - The partners exchange data based on trading partner agreements
       defining the use of the data segments contained within the Life
       reinsurance activity message.
          
       - The message can be sent for purposes of confirming the details of
       a policy or group of policies and the associated insureds and
       coverages under a specific agreement.
          
       - The message can be used to communicate information regarding the
       status of the policy, the changes to the policy and the valuation of
       a policy or group of policies.
          
       - The message structure is generalised by specifying several
       conditional segments and segment groups. Only a subset of the
       conditional segments may be needed to meet particular requirements.
       Users intending to use the message for their particular requirements
       should study the message structure to identify the segments and
       segment groups required to meet their needs.
          
       - The intent of the structural design of this message is to allow
       for optimal efficiency of transmission. The business function has
       the complex "many to many" relationship of insureds to coverages.
       This message allows the flexibility to structure the data in order
       to optimize transmission costs or optimize clarity.
          
       - The message flows among partners; the partners may change roles in
       the transmission. That is to say, that the cedent may be the
       originator of the transmission, or may be the recipient of the
       transmission (from the reinsurer).
          
       - The message is not intended to bear any relation to any particular
       paper report that trading partners may have used. However, the
       proprietary nature of the data in the message is the same as when it
       is sent on a paper report or magnetic media. 
            
       - A "claim status" is included to allow for active policies with
       disability claims. There is no intention to communicate any other
       claims information using this message.
                 
       - The value contained in the GEI segment indicates whether the
       parent segment group contains policy, insured, coverage or
       relationship data. If the parent group contains policy data, then it
       can also contain a policy segment group. If the parent segment group
       contains insured data then it can also contain an insured segment
       group. If the parent segment group contains coverage data, then it
       can also contain a coverage segment group. If the parent segment
       group contains relationship data, then it can contain no other
       segment groups.
                 
       - Coverages can apply to one or more insureds. The relationship
       between insureds and coverages can either be defined implicitly or
       explicitly.
          
       When no relationship groups are defined for a policy, the
       relationship is implicit:
          
       - coverage segment group(s) immediately following an insured segment
       group and before the next policy or insured segment group is related
       to that insured;
          
       - insured segment group(s) immediately following a coverage segment
       group and before the next policy or coverage segment group is
       related to that coverage.
          
       For joint life cases, this method can introduce considerable
       redundancy in the message. To explicitly define the relationship
       between the insureds and the coverages, the relationship segment
       group is used. A policy would then be structured as a policy segment
       group followed by one or more insured segment groups, then one or
       more coverage segment groups, then one or more relationship segment
       groups. Each relationship segment group would contain the insured
       sequence number and the related coverage sequence number.
