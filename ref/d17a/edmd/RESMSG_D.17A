       concerned.

1.2    Field of application

       The Reservation message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Reservation message may cover one or more services provided by one
       or more suppliers for a person or for a group of persons.
       
       This message is part of a scenario which includes research,
       availability query, reservation and cancellation of services
       relating to travel, tourism and leisure.
