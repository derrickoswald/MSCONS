0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container release
       order message (COREOR) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Order to release containers, and giving permission for them to be
       picked up by or on behalf of a specified party.
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified in a
       separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container release order message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic center, Freight forwarder, Inland carrier
       (copy)
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Container depot, Inland terminal, Container freight station, Freight
       forwarder (copy), Inland carrier (copy)
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Container release
       order message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination
       of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer, coded (NAD)
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD)
       - container release reference number (RFF)
       The ordering customer agent, coded is needed to supplement the
       unique identification only in the next situation: the agent acts on
       behalf of several ordering customers issuing the same range of
       reference numbers for each customer.
       E.g. the ship's agent acts on behalf of several shipping lines
       issuing for each shipping line the same range of numbers.
       
       *   One shipping line, one seagoing vessel, one sea voyage number
       and one shipping agent can be specified on message top level.
       
       *   An indicator for the transport status (i.e., export, import,
       transhipment or continental) can be completed on container level
       (EQD-segment).
       
       *   One message may contain several containers identified by their
       prefix and number or several equipment guidelines for groups of
       (empty) containers.
       
       *   Inland transport details can be specified for each individual
       container or can be specified on message level (for all containers
       in the message); the two options must not be used simultaneously.
       
       *   An inland transport charges reference or a sea booking reference
       can be specified either on message level (related to all containers
       in the message) or for each individual container; the two options
       must not be used simultaneously.
       
       *   The final place of positioning can be included in case of
       routing via an inland terminal or several container freight stations
       (for stacking purposes).
       
       *   For each container up to 3 communication addresses can be
       specified to which a copy of the Container gate-in/gate-out report
       message is to be sent.
       
       *   For each container details can be specified such as container
       prefix and number, size/type, loading instructions, special
       instructions, seals, temperature, dangerous goods and off-dimensions
       details.
       
       *   A goods item may be detailed, such as number and type of
       packages, goods description, gross weight, dangerous goods
       information and special instruction.
       
       *   Goods item information can be related to the corresponding
       containers by linking the goods item group (GID) to the container
       details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP-segment.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
