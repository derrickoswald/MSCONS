0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Sales forecast
       message (SLSFCT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to enable the transmission of forecast data related to
       products or services, such as corresponding location, period,
       product identification, pricing, monetary amount, quantity, market
       sector information, sales parties. It enables the recipient to
       process the information automatically and use it for production,
       planning, marketing, statistical purposes, etc.

1.2    Field of application

       The Sales forecast message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message intent is to provide sales forecast information for one
       or more locations for a series of products within a specified time
       period.
       
       The message is transmitted either from a seller to its supplier or
       from a headquarters, coordination or distribution centre to a
       manufacturer, supplier or a third party.
       
       It allows the recipient to know sales forecast for a specific
       product by: 
       
       - Sales location 
       
       - Sales period 
       
       - Product identification 
       
       - Product selling price, quantity and value of the sales 
       
       - Additional Identification of the products such as promotional
       flags, product group or family identification and internal
       identification numbers 
       
       - Periodical Turnover of a specified location 
       
       - Global specified product sales, i.e. total sales of a product in
       all locations 
       
       - Sales channel, market segment end use, if known.
       
       - Sales parties identification, if known.
       
       - Outlet identification, if known.
       
       Though the message is location driven, it is conceivable that the
       recipient process the data to derive information based on other
       variables such as a specific product and all its related sales
       locations and/or addresses or forecasted periodic turnover and the
       related locations.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'yymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.

00010   UNH, Message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Sales forecast message is SLSFCT.

        Note: Sales forecast messages conforming to this document must
        contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

        Data element  0065 SLSFCT
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A
                      0051 UN

           the recipient is mandatory for the Sales Forecast Message. It is
           recommended that where possible only the coded form of the party
           ID should be specified e.g. the sender and receiver of the sales
           forecast are known to each other, thus only the coded ID is
           required, but when a new address might have to be clearly
           specified, this should be done preferably in structured format.

              promotions, e.g. to indicate what type of promotion if any
              will be in effect when the product specified in LIN is to be
              sold.
