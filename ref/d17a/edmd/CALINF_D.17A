0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Vessel call
       information message (CALINF) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Notice from a liner agent to a stevedore providing information
       concerning the expected arrival of a vessel and the expected cargo
       operations.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified in a
       separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Vessel call information message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Vessel call
       information message:
       
       *   A message will contain information on only one means of
       transport/conveyance.
       
       *   Separate messages (Vessel call information message and Vessel
       departure message) will be used for the means of transport in order
       to cater for opening and closing of the information exchange related
       to that means of transport.
       Updates for these messages may be sent.
       
       *  The message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination
       of the following message level data elements for the Container
       Logistics scenario:
       -  Voyage number or indication of sea transport (TDT and/or RFF)
       -  Vessel radio call sign (TDT)
       -  Shipping line (TDT)
       
       *  Both the expected date and/or time of arrival and the expected
       date and/or time of departure of the vessel can be given.
       
       *  For planning purposes, information on the expected handling of
       containers as well as on certain goods item descriptions can be
       completed.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
