0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Drawing
       administration message (CONDRA) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The message will be used for the administration of each exchange of
       a set of engineering/CAD files. It will give additional information
       about the files; for example, their nature, a list of their contents
       and technical information necessary to interpret them.
       
       The whole process of exchanging engineering or CAD (Computer Aided
       Design) files between different parties within projects will be
       supported by EDIFACT messages. The message CONDRA is one of these
       messages.

1.2    Field of application

       The Drawing administration message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The following descriptions refer to the exchange of engineering/CAD
       files, but do not exclude any other type of "native" files, e.g.
       files originating from software packages and tools like word-
       processing, spreadsheet, DTP (Desk Top Publishing), graphics and so
       on.

1.3    Principles

       CONDRA is the EDIFACT message to administer the exchange of
       engineering/CAD files. The message itself does not consist of any
       engineering or graphical information. This information will be
       transferred within files written in existing standard graphical
       exchange formats or native formats, referred to within the message
       as external file reference to identify each of these files. The
       nature of the engineering files and its content is not relevant for
       the syntax of the EDIFACT message. 
        
       All types of engineering/CAD files may be exchanged during a
       project's life cycle. The naming/structuring conventions, including
       project organisation and system environments can be defined in the
       EDIFACT message CONDRO (Drawing Organisation). 
        
       CONDRA will refer to the message CONDRO, previously received by the
       business parties, if there is additional information required about
       the project organisation, system environment and naming/structuring
       convention.

              The scale used can be quoted in this segment.


00460         Segment group 7:  RFF-SG8-SG9
              For each of the levels that are identified in the previous
              BII segment it is possible to refer to other
              messages/documents on other levels of the structure of the
              engineering/CAD file identified in the previous EFI segment.
              It is also possible to refer to other levels which are part
              of a different engineering/CAD file than the one identified
              in the previous EFI segment. If needed, here should also be
              made a reference to a contractual document or to a revision
              number.

00470            RFF, Reference
                 An ID number will be used to refer to either another
                 message/document or to another engineering/CAD file. If
                 needed, here should also be made a reference to a
                 contractual document or to a revision number.


00480            Segment group 8:  DOC-DTM
                 If the reference number quoted in the previous RFF segment
                 is a reference to another message/document, this segment
                 group is used to give more details about this
                 message/document.

00490               DOC, Document/message details

00510            Segment group 9:  SEQ-BII-RFF-GEI-DTM-IMD
                 This segment group will be used when a reference is made
                 to another specific level in the structure of an
                 engineering/CAD file.
                 If in the previous RFF segment a standard dummy value is
                 quoted, the level referred to is part of the
                 engineering/CAD file identified in the previous EFI
                 segment. If, however, in the previous RFF segment any
                 other value is quoted, the level described in the
                 following BII segment is part of the engineering/CAD file
                 identified by the ID number.
