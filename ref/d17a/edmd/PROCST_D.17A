0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Project cost
       reporting message (PROCST) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Project cost reporting message is used in various industry
       sectors when there is a requirement for all parties involved in a
       project to formally establish and exchange budget baseline, actual,
       progress, and estimate to complete cost information; technical
       performance measurement information; and related funding
       information. This information exchange is typically going from a
       contractor performing the work to the end customer.
       
       The purpose of this information exchange is to provide the end
       customer with data that describes the work that must be completed,
       who is doing the work, and establishes the cost budget baseline for
       the project. This information exchange also provides data that
       describes how the work is progressing against the cost baseline to
       determine if the project will complete on time and within budget.
       The work in process measurement data provides key management
       information to ensure the project is progressing as planned and
       highlights any problem areas that need correcting. Technical
       performance measurement data is used to determine if the project is
       meeting specific design or functional objectives. Periodic funding
       data reporting is used to track future funding requirements for the
       work in process.

1.2    Field of application

       The Project cost reporting message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The industry sectors that typically exchange project cost
       information include construction, aerospace, aircraft, defense, and
       software or support services. Various government entities such as
       transportation, energy, space, and defense exchange project cost
       information with their contractors related to construction, software
       development, research and development, and production. For these
       various government entities, this project cost information is
       typically part of the contractual requirements for the preparation,
       status, and completion of a project, particularly for departments or
       ministries of defense for weapon system acquisition.
       
       Although various regional and international differences do exist in
       the business terms used for project cost reporting, the underlying
       business requirements are similar. Various ministries of defense
       around the world have formed an international performance
       measurement council that has established similar policy and
       principles for project cost performance measurement and reporting.
       These international policies and principles are the underlying
       foundation for the data content in the Project cost reporting
       message.

1.3    Principles

       This message is designed to convey budget, actual, earned value, and
       estimate to complete cost data; technical performance measurement
       data; and related funding data about a project in a neutral data
       format.
       
       This information exchange provides data on how work is progressing
       against the original plan or budget baseline as well as specific
       design or functional objectives and to provide funding status
       related to the project. This progress information provides key
       management information needed to verify that work is progressing as
       planned, that work will complete on time and within budget, and meet
       project objectives. Progress payments can also be tied to the amount
       of work the contractor completes on the project; this reporting
       information can serve as the basis for these progress payments.
       
       This message can be used to exchange project cost information
       between commercial off the shelf or company unique program
       management software applications. Typically this data exchange is
       external to a company. This data is exchanged with a company's
       customers which could be a government entity, another contractor, or
       with one or more teaming partner doing work on a project.
       
       Data exchanged in the PROCST message can also relate to information
       conveyed in the Project Tasks Planning (PROTAP) message which
       provides more information about the tasks to be performed, who is
       doing the work, and when it will be done. This PROCST message
       provides the related cost data (budget, actual, earned value,
       estimate to complete and related funding requirements) and any
       related technical performance measurements for the work activities
       required to complete a project. Many times the work schedule, the
       focus of the PROTAP message, provides the foundation to build the
       cost budget baseline. This cost budget baseline serves as the
       foundation to measure how work is progressing against the plan
       (actual and earned value costs) and to develop the estimate to
       complete costs and related completion dates.
       
       This message does use externally maintained code lists for such
       details related to the contract type, program type, security
       references, appropriation, and funding notations. An external code
       list is also used to note the specific reporting formats as required
       by the various ministries of defense or other government agencies.
       
       Data Content
       
       This message was designed to convey high level, general information
       about a project and related reporting structure detail.
       
       The header section of this message is designed to convey project
       attributes such as contract and program type, references,
       descriptions, related documents, total contract monetary and percent
       details, end item deliverable details (how many and what is being
       delivered to the end customer), and contractor contact information.
       
       The detail section of this message is designed to convey information
       at three levels of detail. The highest level of detail is the report
       level. For example, the cost performance data may need to be
       conveyed using different reporting structures, focus on baseline
       changes, or forecast labor requirements. Line item information is
       used to indicate what report format is being conveyed. In addition,
       for a given report, a segment group is included in the detail
       section to describe out-year time frames when reporting data needs
       to be compressed for a project that spans many years.
       
       Within a report, the detail is further broken down by specific
       reporting structure elements. This is the second level of detail.
       This is where the budget, actual, earned value, estimate, and where
       needed, technical performance measurement and funding data is
       provided by specific reporting element references.
       
       Within a reporting structure, depending on contract requirements,
       the reporting structure information may need to be broken down by
       cost elements such as labor or material detail or more specific
       detail such as engineering labor. This is the third level of detail.
       When the third level of detail is used, generally, the budget,
       actual, earned value, and estimate detail data is included at this
       level instead of at level two (reporting structure only). However,
       the two levels can be combined to provide summary reporting
       structure cost data and detail cost element cost data.
       
       Typically the data sent is status information (weekly, monthly, or
       quarterly). The data will generally be used to update an application
       with new periodic data. In the event a contractor needs to
       retransmit a report, the receiving application or receiving party's
       business environment will dictate how the new data is managed. In
       some instances, the contractor may need to replan their project. In
       that event, it may be necessary to transmit new baseline data.
       Again, the receiving application or receiving party's business
       environment will dictate how the new data is managed.
       
       Multiple Report Formats
       
       This message has been designed to indicate the general category of
       cost data at the header level with the ability to indicate the
       various report formats at the detail level. This structure allows
       the message to contain one or more report formats for a given cost
       report category. This also allows the contractor to submit some of
       the required formats at one time and others at a later time, as
       needed.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

3.2    Message terms and definitions

       EARNED VALUE:
       Earned value represents a fundamental data component for cost
       performance reporting purposes. It provides the foundation to
       determine if work is progressing as planned.
       
       Earned value costs identify how much work has been completed for the
       money spent. When earned value costs are compared to the budget
       baseline costs, it provides an objective measure to determine how
       much work was actually accomplished or the schedule variance (ahead
       or behind) in cost terms. When earned value costs are compared to
       the actual costs spent on the work completed, it provides an
       objective measure to determine how much it cost to complete the work
       or the cost variance (over or under). These cost and schedule
       indicators highlight problem areas in a project and provides
       objective, statistical measures to determine if a project will
       complete on time and within budget.
       
       REPORTING STRUCTURES:
       Reporting structures represent the various coding structures used to
       identify work being done a project. They serve as the foundation to
       plan, manage, and measure work completed. Generally, the reporting
       structures include a Work Breakdown Structure (what) and an
       Organizational Breakdown Structure (who) or a combination of the two
       such as integrated process teams. The reporting structure coding
       scheme may be significant or non-significant in nature.
       
       A reporting structure that is significant in nature indicates that
       the next higher level in the reporting structure tree can be
       determined by dropping one or more characters from the end of the
       structure code.
       
       A reporting structure that is non-significant in nature indicates
       that the reporting structure uses a unique scheme of coding at each
       level. The next higher level code in the reporting structure tree
       cannot be determined by dropping one or more characters from the end
       of the structure code.
       
       TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT:
       Technical performance measurements are used to quantify specific
       design or functional objectives that a project must meet to satisfy
       contract requirements. This can include such statistical
       measurements as speed, range, reliability factors, or other
       quantifiable product or process metrics. Technical performance
       measurements also provide an early warning about the adequacy of a
       design to satisfy critical technical requirements of an end product.
       
       OUT-YEAR:
       Many contracts that will use the PROCST message to exchange project
       cost information between a contractor and their customer span many
       years. For a large production type of contract, it can span 10, 20,
       or more years. For reporting purposes, many times the cost data for
       future years are lumped into specific period based groups such as
       quarters, semi-annual, annual, or remainder of contract. These
       future year period based groups are the out-year categories for the
       contract. As the contract progresses, the future year period groups
       are broken down into more detail to provide visibility into past,
       current, and near-term effort, typically into monthly reporting
       periods.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The header section for this message includes project unique
       identifying details, general project information, details about the
       parties exchanging data, and any related external files. Information
       in the header section applies to the entire message.
       
       The detail section for this message includes the report format and
       reporting element cost, technical performance measurement, and
       funding data. The detail section is structured into three levels of
       detail. The highest level of detail is the report format and any
       associated out-year data compression details. The second level of
       detail is the reporting structure element. This reporting structure
       element can be further broken down into a third level of detail, the
       cost elements. Budget, earned value, actual, estimate to complete
       data, and technical performance measurement data can be conveyed at
       the reporting structure element level (level two), at the cost
       element level within a reporting structure element (level three), or
       both.
       
       The summary section provides an optional control total segment for
       checking purposes.
