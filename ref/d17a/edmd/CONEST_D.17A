0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Establishment of
       contract message (CONEST) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Upon completion of the tendering process, there is a requirement for
       the client or his representative to formally establish and issue the
       contractual Bill of Quantities. This documentation becomes the
       contractual basis for all future work and payment for the project.

1.2    Field of application

       The Establishment of contract message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The following descriptions refer to the construction industry as an
       example, but do not exclude other business sectors' implementation.

1.3    Principles

       A BoQ is a set of documentation that describes the various facets of
       work that make up a construction project. This documentation is
       often quite voluminous and typically contains information structured
       in accordance with several industry standards.
       
       This documentation, or parts of it, is frequently exchanged between
       the parties involved in the project.
       
       A project is typically subdivided into individual groupings of work
       and within these groups are detailed work items. It is at the level
       of these detailed items that progress and payments are evaluated. 
       
       During the life of a project numerous amendments to the original
       contractual BoQ will be made. This CONEST message will be used to
       establish all such approved amendments.
       
       The post tender exchange of contractual information occurs many
       times in the life cycle of a project, thus there is a role for this
       CONEST message throughout the duration of a project.
       
       The initial exchange takes place at the point the two principal
       parties in the project, the Client and the Main Contractor, agree a
       contract. At this point the entire BoQ will be issued by the
       Client's representative to the Main Contractor. This will replace
       any previous versions of BoQ's used during the tendering process.
       
       Further BoQ exchanges continue from the Client's representative to
       the Main Contractor as the project progress. These subsequent
       exchanges reflect the evaluation of the project and are used to
       amend the original contractual documentation with changes approved
       by both parties.
       
       The other major area of use for this message standard is during the
       exchange between the Main Contractor and those companies that have
       contracts to undertake subcontracted work within the project. The
       procedures are similar to those described above, as they too are
       establishing and maintaining contractual details, this time for
       subdivisions of the overall project with the Main Contractor as the
       "Client".
       
       This is only one of a number of messages being designed for the BoQ
       and the principles for this CONEST message are consistent with those
       adopted for each of the BoQ messages.
       
       There are several concepts to be understood and these are key to
       some of the design principles adopted. Most of these have been
       created to respond to two base problems associated with the BoQ
       documentation: 
       
       i) A BoQ is often a very large document, it is not unusual for it to
       run to several volumes in its paper form.
       
       ii) Given the size of the document, there is also the problem of how
       to advise on the structure to which the document conforms and the
       accurate indexing and sequencing of information within such a volume
       of data.
       
       1.3.1 Work Items 
       
       Each individual component of work referred to in the BoQ is called a
       "work item" and it is at this level that progress and payments are
       evaluated.
       
       For each work item a description is provided and this description is
       very precise in its wording. This results in two things: 
       
       i) A lot of repetitive descriptions for like items at least at the
       higher levels within these levelled descriptions.
       
       ii) A lot of similar work items, indeed the same description, often
       occurs a number of times throughout the project but assigned to
       different work items. 
       
       Point ii) above has been addressed by a concept called "standard
       items", this enables an equivalent to standard library of
       descriptions to be exchanged and individual work items to reference
       a standard description that need be sent, only once.
       
       Frequently within a BoQ, elements of an item's description are
       common to adjacent items. When this happens the items which share
       the same description are grouped together and the common part of the
       description is presented once at the start of the group. This
       concept is used extensively and it is possible to have quite a
       number of layers of shared heading.
       
       Two distinctions need to be established: firstly, the existence of
       Heading text which is related to an item. There can be multiples of
       these as in the levels of a standard description. The second
       distinction is that of "Groups". Where a group is a collection of
       more than one work item and all of these items have a common theme.
       For example: 
       
       - they all belong to the same trade 
       - all for the same part of the project, building or structure.
       
       Despite the large number of items that they may embrace, or the fact
       that they represent substantial parts of the project, all of these
       are recognised as "groups".
       
       Thus, there can be several or many items within a group and there
       can be layers of groups within groups, all of which collectively
       constitute the project.
       
       1.3.2 Indexing 
       
       There are numerous variations for structuring the information that
       makes up the BoQ. Although, it is possible to introduce some
       standardisation it is clear that any message must allow the freedom
       to structure the data according to the dictates of a individual
       project. The design therefore, includes the ability to convey the
       document's structure as part of the BoQ message. Indeed the design
       allows for a different set of document structuring information, to
       be defined at group level as well as globally for the project. This
       means that a set of indexing rules can be defined to apply to the
       entire project and that a different set of indexing rules can be
       used to override these for a given group(s).
       
       To complement the indexing concept there is a component referred to
       as the "Project Index Reference". This is a faceted code assigned to
       all items of data that are to be used in conjunction with the index.
       In other words, all pieces of data that are to be structured using
       the index must contain a structured code composed in accordance with
       the index, and this is used as a "sorting" mechanism to ensure that
       the data is correctly structured.
       
       1.3.3 Message format 
       
       The actual appearance of the message bears no relation to the
       appearance of the current paper document.
       
       As there are unlimited permutations for assembling the BoQ data it
       has not been possible, nor desirable to make the appearance similar.
       The CONEST appearance is similar to the results of the data analysis
       exercise. Namely that there are 4 blocks or groupings of data, each
       of which can appear many times and that all of the mechanisms for
       linking and relating the components together are data elements
       within these blocks. The task of interpreting the indexing rules and
       subsequently assembling the data in the message will fall to local
       software.
       
       This approach has several advantages over the existing rigidity of
       the paper document. It is clear to the message design team that BoQ
       documentation exchanged using EDI will deliver a variety of new
       opportunities to its users.
       
       This last principle offers the solution to the volume problem too.
       One message has a definitive number of occurrences for each block of
       data. If for a "large" project this number is exceeded then multiple
       versions of the same message are built. It also enables a BoQ to be
       exchanged in subdivisions if so desired.
