0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Superannuation
       maintenance message (SUPMAN) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Superannuation Maintenance Message is sent by a party to an
       organisation administering a superannuation scheme, to specify
       membership maintenance information about superannuation scheme
       members.

1.2    Field of application

       The Superannuation maintenance message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Superannuation Maintenance Message gives information about
       updates or reviews of superannuation scheme member details for
       retirement benefit purposes.
       
       - The message may be used to provide information about a single
       member as well as multiple members employed by the same employer.
       
       - The message structure is generalised by specifying several
       conditional segments and segment groups. Only a subset of the
       conditional segments may be needed to meet particular requirements.
       If necessary, specific subsets may be associated with the
       document/message name identification in the BGM segment or with
       other provided identifiers. Users intending to use the message
       should study the conditional segments and segment groups to decide
       which are necessary for their application.
       
       - A Superannuation Maintenance Message may be sent by an employer,
       on behalf of an employer or any other authorised party.
       
       - A Superannuation Maintenance Message is based on agreements
       between the parties.
