General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Medical service
       report message (MEDRPT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Medical Service Report message is sent from a service provider to
       the service requester to report new results on performed
       investigations, to modify a previous result item or a complete
       result report or to cancel a previous result report.

1.2    Field of application

       The Medical service report message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message fulfils the requirements of the European pre-standard
       concerning messages for exchange of laboratory information within
       clinical chemistry, clinical biochemistry, toxicology, clinical
       immunology, immunohaematology, haematology and clinical
       microbiology. The message may, however, also be used for other
       purposes as long as the user requirements are met.
       
       The CEN prENV New Laboratory Service Report message and the CEN
       prENV Laboratory Service Report Cancellation message may be
       considered as special cases of the CEN prENV Laboratory Service
       Report Modification message. The Laboratory Service Report
       Modification message may contain a mixture of new, change, cancel
       and other service types for the report itself and for the various
       result items whereas the New Laboratory Service Report message only
       contains the new service type for the report itself and the various
       result items and the Laboratory Service Report Cancellation message
       only contains the cancel service type for a complete report.
       
       The overall structure of the message is:
       - One message may include one or more service reports.
       - Every report may relate to zero, one or more service orders.
       - Every service report may contain one or more result items for the
       subject of investigation, each result item may be composed of zero,
       one or more other result items.
       - Every service report is related to one main subject of
       investigation (patient, animal or material), but may also include
       information about related subjects of investigation.
       - One message may report on one or more samples (from the same
       subject of investigation) or the subject of investigation itself.
       - An investigation may be connected to one or more samples or to the
       subject of investigation itself.
       - Every investigation may have one result.
       - Every result item may have zero, one or more related service
       providers.
       
       Most of the information sent from the requester to the receiving
       service provider may be returned to the requester in this message.
       
       With the exception of information in FTX segments, all information
       should primarily be expressed as codes.
