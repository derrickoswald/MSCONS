0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Instruction
       message (IFTMIN) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Instruction Message to be
       used in fulfilling the requirements of trading partners in the
       transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of cargo and transport
       related information using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
       
       This message is a single consignment based message, being aligned
       with other single consignment based messages such as the booking
       messages  (IFTMBP, IFTMBF and IFTMBC), the Instruction Contract
       Status Message (IFTMCS) and the Arrival Notice Message (IFTMAN).
       The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes of
       transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any origin
       to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial
       practice.
       
       These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the transport of
       goods between all parties to the movement of the consignment
       (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the
       forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as providing the
       information necessary to perform that transport and delivery of the
       goods.
       
       They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport when
       the requirements are common even if functionally similar information
       is known by different names.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from the party issuing an instruction regarding
       forwarding/transport services for a consignment under conditions
       agreed, to the party arranging the forwarding and/or transport
       services.

1.2    Field of application

       The Instruction message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The instruction results in a transport contract for a consignment
       and is primarily meant for administrative purposes. It will be the
       message from shipper to carrier or forwarder containing the final
       details of  the consignment for which services are provided. The
       instruction message is the one and only message which results in the
       actual contract which can either be a document or an electronic
       contract.
       
       If only one message will suffice in an exchange between a shipper
       and a carrier/forwarder the instruction message should be the one as
       this message is the only message that results in a contract. The
       receiving party is to ascertain whether the Instruction message is
       preceded by a Booking Firm message, to be able to interpret the
       function as being an administrative message only or an
       administrative and operational message.
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a
       single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in
       one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order
       transport for one or more goods items.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or issue
       instructions of transport to be arranged for several goods items by
       means of one or several of the following messages: IFTMBP, IFTMBF,
       IFTMBC, IFTMIN, IFTMCS, IFTMAN.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination
       haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or
       instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified
       with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a
       temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on
       another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to
       or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a
       container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on
       their own, are specified in the transport details group. Other load
       or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up
       to three levels.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.

       to be described as:

       * TYPE OF EQUIPMENT: The type of material used, e.g. 40 feet
       container, four way pallet, mafi trailer.
