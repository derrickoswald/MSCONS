0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container special
       handling order message (COHAOR) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Order to perform a specified special handling and/or service on
       containers.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange. 
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified in a
       separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container special handling order message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic center, Freight forwarder
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Container terminal, Container depot, Inland terminal, Container
       freight station
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Container special
       handling order message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination
       of the following data elements:
       - message sender (NAD)
       - ordering customer (NAD)
       - work order reference (RFF)
       
       *   A combination of the following data elements can be used in
       order to relate to business data contained in other container-
       related messages: container prefix and number (EQD)
       
       *   In one message special handling orders for several containers
       can be specified.
       
       *   The ultimate execution date and time of the special handling
       order can be included.
       
       *   For each container the sea-going vessel, sea voyage number can
       be given.
       
       *   The special handling orders are to be coded, completed with
       comments, if any.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
