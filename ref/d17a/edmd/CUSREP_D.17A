0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Customs conveyance
       report message (CUSREP) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This Customs Conveyance Report Message (CUSREP) permits the transfer
       of data from a carrier to a Customs administration for the purpose
       of meeting Customs reporting requirements in respect of the means of
       transport on which cargo is carried.

1.2    Field of application

       The Customs conveyance report message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       It is envisaged that the Customs Conveyance Report Message may be
       initiated by the carrier to report details of the means of transport
       on which cargo is conveyed to a Customs administration. The message
       is transmitted upon arrival of the vessel, flight, etc., or where
       national legislation permits, prior to arrival. The data provides a
       means of establishing the basis of a cargo inventory report for the
       conveyance in question. Details of individual consignments carried
       on the conveyance will be subsequently transmitted to Customs using
       a CUSCAR message or a series of such messages. It also allows
       Customs to undertake selectivity processing in order to select high
       risk conveyances and shipments requiring examination.
       
       The message embodies reporting requirements of all modes of
       transport. Each message covers the data requirements for one
       conveyance. The message may be used for reporting empty containers
       as well as numbers of passengers and crew.
