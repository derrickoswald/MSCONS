       message (CHACCO) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message deals with the communication of charts of accounts
       between an organization and whoever may use them for the purpose of
       accounting, auditing, cost accounting, consolidation, financial
       analysis, etc.

1.2    Field of application

       The Chart of accounts message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The chart of accounts may be set up by an enterprise, a service
       bureau, a chartered accountant or an auditor - referred to as sender
       - for appropriate parties - known as recipient - such another
       enterprise, another service bureau, another chartered accountant or
       another auditor. 
       
       The chart of accounts is a systematically organized list of accounts
       that is sufficiently detailed to allow the recording of operations
       affecting the financial conditions of an organization. The chart of
       accounts can be either in accordance with sector-based accounting
       standards, national or international, or those established by an
       organization. 
       
       The message CHACCO contains information about a set of accounts for
       a given period. The frequency of data collection ranges from daily
       to annually.
