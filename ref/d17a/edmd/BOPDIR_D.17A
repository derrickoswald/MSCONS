0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Direct balance of
       payment declaration message (BOPDIR) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Direct balance of payments declaration message (BOPDIR) can be
       sent by non-bank residents to report directly to the Balance of
       Payments (BOP) compiler on:
       * transactions via bank accounts held at a resident bank
       * transactions via bank accounts held at a non-resident bank
       * transactions and clearing via accounts with non-bank non-
       residents
       * foreign assets and liabilities
       * information in the context of a BOP-related survey (stock and
       flows); for those countries which base their compilation of the
       Balance of Payments on surveys.

1.2    Field of application

       The Direct balance of payment declaration message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message contains 2 parts:
       
       In the first part of the message, it is used to supply information
       on amounts received from non-residents via resident banks. This is
       an alternative route to sending a BOPINF message to the bank.
       
       In the second part, this message can also be used for reporting on
       settlements via external bank accounts, current accounts held abroad
       with non-banks or participation in an international clearing system.
       
       Further, this message part can also be used for reporting results
       for all types of BOP-related surveys: either for reporting results
       of general questionnaires or for specific questionnaires such as the
       reports on positions (foreign assets and liabilities).
       
       Each part is independent from each other. A message can contain
       either or both of them.
