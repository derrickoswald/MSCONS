0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Work grant request
       message (WKGRRE) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying details of requests to a governmental authority
       from an employer for workers who need a work grant or permit.

1.2    Field of application

       The Work grant request message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message is to provide detailed information of one or more
       requests.
       
       A Work grant request message is transmitted from an employer to a
       governmental agency.
       
       A Work grant request message may contain requested detailed
       information about a person (i.e.: the address, the profession, the
       location of the job and the remuneration).
       
       A Work grant request message may also be used for a modification or
       an extension of an existing work grant request.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd' or
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that
       there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods
       should be specified as whole numbers representing the required
       period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
