0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the International
       multimodal status report message (IFTSTA) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to report the transport status and/or a change in the
       transport status (i.e. event) between agreed parties.

1.2    Field of application

       The International multimodal status report message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message allows for the exchange of information regarding the
       status of the physical movement of consignments, goods or equipment
       at any point (in time or place) within the full transport chain.
              
       A status message may be sent:
       - as the result of request/s for consignment/s or equipment
       status/es
       - on a scheduled basis at predetermined times
       - on the occurrence of a selected event/s
       - on the occurrence of an exceptional event as agreed by the
       partners involved.
              
       This message can relate to a status (or statuses) that has or have
       been reached in a transport chain.
              
       The transport working group (TBG3) has developed recommendations for
       a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the TBG3 secretariat.
