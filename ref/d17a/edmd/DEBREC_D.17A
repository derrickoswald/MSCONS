0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Debts recovery
       message (DEBREC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to exchange detailed information relating to debts
       recovery cases between appropriate parties (principal, enacting
       party). This message may cover one or more event (e.g. submission,
       status information) for one or more debts recovery cases.

1.2    Field of application

       The Debts recovery message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A debts recovery is a process started by a party to recover money
       from a debtor (e.g. social security contributions not paid by a
       company).
       
       The debts recovery message may be used:
       a. when issued by the principal, to:
       - submit new debts recovery cases,
       - update debts recovery cases,
       - request processing actions for debts recovery cases,
       - request status of debts recovery cases
       b. when issued by the enacting party, to:
       - acknowledge debts recovery case submissions,
       - give status information about debts recovery cases,
       - request information about debts recovery cases,
       - request instructions for debts recovery cases,
       - update debts recovery cases.
       
       In both cases (issuing party is principal or enacting party) each
       message relates to one principal and one or more debt recovery
       cases. Each debts recovery case relates to one debt. Each debt may
       be split into one or more debt components (set of monetary amounts
       related to the debts recovery case).
       
       The way the content of the message is used depends on and is
       triggered by the possible events previously described (e.g.
       submission, update of debts recovery cases).
       
       The DEBREC message is not meant to be used for invoicing or payment
       activities.
       
       Note: It could happen that the principal of a debts recovery case is
       the enacting party of another debts recovery case (e.g. case
       transmission from one enacting party to another for geographical
       reasons).
