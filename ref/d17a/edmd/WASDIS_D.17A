0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Waste disposal
       information message (WASDIS) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to convey information on last inspection and/or on waste
       and cargo residues on board of a means of transport (e.g. vessel)
       and/or equipment related to a means of transport - and still to be
       disposed in the next place or port of call of the means of
       transport.

1.2    Field of application

       The Waste disposal information message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message has been designed to enable control of pollution caused
       by a means of transport, e.g. in the maritime and port environment. 
       * The message relates to one means of transport and/or equipment
       related to a means of transport. 
       * The message can be sent by a shipping agent to an authority (e.g.
       a port) or a centralized database of authorities
       * The message can be sent by an authority (e.g. a port)  to an
       authority in the next place or port of call of the means of
       transport (e.g. a vessel) or to a search or rescue organization
       Business area: control of pollution by a means of transport (e.g.
       maritime pollution)
