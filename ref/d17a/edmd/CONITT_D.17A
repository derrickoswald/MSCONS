0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Invitation to
       tender message (CONITT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       At the pre-construction stage of a construction project, the Client
       will wish to appoint a contractor to execute the works. The first
       step in this appointment process is to issue an invitation to tender
       (ITT) to contractors this will require a commercial offer to be made
       by the contractor to the client.

1.2    Field of application

       The Invitation to tender message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The following descriptions refer to the construction industry as an
       example, but do not exclude other business sectors' implementation.

1.3    Principles

       A BoQ is a set of documentation that describes the various facets of
       work that make up a construction project. This documentation is
       often quite voluminous and typically contains information structured
       in accordance with several industry standards.
       
       The BoQ is a key set of documentation for a number of stages within
       the overall construction process. This documentation, or parts of
       it, are frequently exchanged between the various parties involved in
       the project.
       
       A significant document used within the invitation to tender process
       is the Bill of Quantities (BoQ). This documentation subsequently
       becomes the contractual basis for the project.
       
       A project is typically subdivided into individual groupings of work
       and within these groups are detailed work items. It is down to this
       level of detailed work items that commercial offer information is to
       be supplied.
       
       If there are any project design changes during the tender period,
       which have an impact on the detailed work items in a BoQ, these
       would also be communicated in a CONITT message.
       
       Although the initial exchange typically takes place at the pre-
       tender stage, it may also be used post-tender.
       
       At the pre-tender stage, one or more competing Main Contractors will
       be sent by the Client or his representative, a BoQ document for the
       purpose of pricing the detailed work items to support the commercial
       tender offer. The Main Contractors in turn may wish to invite
       tenders from subcontractors for specialist portions of the project.
       This would be done by each competing Main Contractor creating
       subsets of the original BoQ document for each type of specialist
       work and sending that in turn to a number of competing
       subcontractors of their choice.
       
       Once the main contract has been established with the successful Main
       Contractor, the ITT process will in some cases be repeated with
       subcontractors. This will enable the Main Contractor to seek
       improved offers from subcontractors following the securement of the
       contract.
       
       This is only one of a number of messages being designed for the BoQ
       and the principles for this CONITT message are consistent with those
       adopted for each of the other BoQ messages.
       
       There are several concepts to be understood and these are key to
       some of the design principles adopted. Most of these have been
       created to respond to two base problems associated with the BoQ
       documentation: 
       
       i) A BoQ is often a very large document, it is not unusual for it to
       run to several volumes in its paper form.
       
       ii) Given the size of the documents, there is also the problem of
       how to advise on the structure to which the document conforms and
       the accurate indexing and sequencing of information within such a
       volume of data.
       
       1.3.1 Work Items 
       
       Each individual component of work referred to in the BoQ is called a
       "work item" and it is at this level that progress and payments are
       evaluated. For each work item a description is provided and this
       description is very precise in its wording. This results in two
       things: 
       
       i) A lot of repetitive descriptions for like items at least at the
       higher levels within these levelled descriptions.
       
       ii) A lot of similar work items, indeed the same description, often
       occurs a number of times throughout the project but assigned to
       different work items.
       
       Point ii) above has been addressed by a concept called " standard
       items", this enables an equivalent to a standard library of
       descriptions to be exchanged and individual work items to reference
       a standard description that need be sent, only once.
       
       Frequently within a BoQ, elements of an item's description are
       common to adjacent items. When this happens the items which share
       the same description are grouped together and the common part of the
       description is presented once at the start of the group. This
       concept is used extensively and it is possible to have quite a
       number of layers of shared heading.
       
       Two distinctions need to be established, firstly, the existence of
       Heading text which is related to an item. There can be multiples of
       these as in the levels of a standard description. The second
       distinction is that of "Groups". Where a group is a collection of
       more than one work item and all of these items have a common theme.
       For example: 
       
       - they all belong to the same trade 
       - all for the same part of the project, building or structure.
       
       Despite the large number of items that they may embrace, or the fact
       that they represent substantial parts of the project, all of these
       are recognised as "groups".
       
       Thus, there can be several or many items within a group and there
       can be layers of groups within groups, all of which collectively
       constitute the project.
       
       1.3.2 Indexing
       
        There are numerous variations for structuring the information that
       makes up the BoQ. Although, it is possible to introduce some
       standardisation it is clear that any message must allow the freedom
       to structure the data according to the dictates of a individual
       project. The design therefore, includes the ability to convey the
       document's structure as part of the BoQ message. Indeed the design
       allows for a different set of document structuring information, to
       be defined at group level as well as globally for the project. This
       means that a set of indexing rules can be defined to apply to the
       entire project and that a different set of indexing rules can be
       used to override these for a given group(s).
       
       To complement the indexing concept there is a component referred to
       as the "Project Index Reference". This is a faceted code assigned to
       all items of data that are to be used in conjunction with the index.
       In other words all pieces of data that are to be structured using
       the index must contain a structured code composed in accordance with
       the index and this is used as a "sorting" mechanism to ensure that
       the data is correctly structured.
       
       1.3.3 Message format 
       
       The actual appearance of the message bears no relation to the
       appearance of the current paper document.
       
       As there are unlimited permutations for assembling the BoQ data it
       has not been possible, nor desirable to make the appearance similar.
       The CONITT appearance is similar to the results of the data analysis
       exercise. Namely that there are 4 blocks or groupings of data, each
       of which can appear many times and that all of the mechanisms for
       linking and relating the components together are data elements
       within these blocks. The task of interpreting the indexing rules and
       subsequently assembling the data in the message will fall to local
       software. The complexity of this task has been simplified by
       grouping the data elements into the blocks described above. In this
       way the processing can follow a logical flow.
       This approach has several advantages over the existing rigidity of
       the paper document. It is clear to the message design team that BoQ
       documentation exchanged using EDI will deliver a variety of new
       opportunities to its users.
       
       This last principle offers the solution to the volume problem too.
       One message has a definitive number of occurrences for each block of
       data. If for a "large" project this number is exceeded then multiple
       versions of the same message are built. It also enables a BoQ to be
       exchanges in subdivisions if so desired.
