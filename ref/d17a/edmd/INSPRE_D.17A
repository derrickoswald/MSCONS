0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Insurance premium
       message (INSPRE) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Insurance Premium message is used by communicating parties to
       notify the recipient about premiums due from a client. All
       information needed to produce a detailed request for payment can be
       sent.

1.2    Field of application

       The Insurance premium message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The Insurance Premium message is applicable for both national and
       international insurance.

1.3    Principles

       - The Insurance Premium Message refers to one single insurance
       contract.
       
       - The Insurance Premium Message covers all classes of insurance
       business.
       
       - The Insurance Premium Message can be used for : 
       
       a. the first premium of a new insurance contract.
       
       b. a premium due to an endorsement to an insurance contract 
       
       c. a renewal premium.
       
       d. any adjustment of premium.
       
       e. any down payment of premium.
       
       - In case of the first two usages on the above list, a separate
       message containing the Insurance Contract information will be needed
       ( to be developed ).
       
       - The Insurance Premium Message structure is as follows :
       
       a. general information valid for the whole message.
       
       b. information on the involved parties.
       
       c. detailed description of cover, amounts and all related
       information.
       
       d. total amounts valid for the whole message.
