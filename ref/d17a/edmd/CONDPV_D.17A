General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Direct payment
       valuation message (CONDPV) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message is the instruction by the contractor to the party
       responsible for payments, to pay the subcontractors for work
       completed.

1.2    Field of application

       The Direct payment valuation message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The following descriptions refer to the construction industry as an
       example, but do not exclude other business sectors' implementation.

1.3    Principles

       This message is designed to be used to support the business process
       of communicating the value of progress against groups of work items
       which make up a construction project.
       
       Within the construction industry, it is common practice to
       subcontract "packages" of work to other parties. It is also common
       practice for this type of work to be paid for on a "phased" basis.
       
       This message will be raised by the party responsible for overseeing
       the subcontracted work. It will contain the identity of the
       subcontractor and the value of payment approved for the current
       payment period. The recipient of this message, typically the client,
       will treat this as an instruction to pay.
       
       The identity of the various subcontracted parties and details of
       their bank accounts, etc, will have been established at the start of
       the project in an appropriate message.
       
       As it is possible for new subcontractors to be nominated during the
       life of a project provision has been made within this message to
       record the basic details about such a subcontractor. The payments
       made to subcontractors are subject to similar price fluctuation
       indices as apply to the CONPVA message.
