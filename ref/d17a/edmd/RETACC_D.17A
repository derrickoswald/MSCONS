General Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Reinsurance
       technical account message (RETACC) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The RETACC is used by the sender to report to the receiver the
       latter's position in the sender's books with respect to one single
       reinsurance contract. It is in this sense a type of account for
       services rendered, and may initiate a payment flow either directly
       or via a periodical overview statement.

1.2    Field of application

       The Reinsurance technical account message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The RETACC will report technical and financial accounting entries
       that are informational (i.e. the latter items such as reserves will
       not impact the balance of the account).
       In the summary section of the RETACC, the ability is given to split
       the account balance into sub-amounts using different criteria. Such
       sub-amounts may be collectable and non- collectable. One may even go
       a level further and split a non- collectable balance into amounts
       per company or participant.
