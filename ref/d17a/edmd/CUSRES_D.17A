0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Customs response
       message (CUSRES) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This Customs Response Message (CUSRES) permits the transfer of data
       from a customs administration:
       
       - to acknowledge the receipt of the message
       - to indicate whether the information received is correct or if
       there are errors (i.e. accepted without errors, accepted with
       errors, rejected, etc.)
       - to inform the sender of the status of the customs declaration
       (i.e. goods released, goods for examination, documents required,
       etc.)
       - to transmit additional information as agreed between parties (i.e.
       tax information, quantity information, etc.)
       - to respond to batched messages (i.e. CUSDEC, CUSCAR, CUSREP,
       CUSEXP).
       
       Note: this message is not meant to replace the functionality of the
       CONTRL message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Customs response message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       It is envisaged that this message will allow a customs
       administration to respond to any customs message, including the
       possibility to respond to multi-consignment and batched messages. It
       is recognized that this message may be used by other parties to
       respond to customs messages.
