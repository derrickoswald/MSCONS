General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Worker's insurance
       history message (SSRECH) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The SSRECH message is sent by a designated body in one State to the
       equivalent body in another State giving details of a worker's Social
       Security insurance history as requested by the latter State.

1.2    Field of application

       The Worker's insurance history message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       When an institution receives from a foreign institution a message
       SSREGW requesting details of a worker's Social Security insurance
       history, it answers to this request sending a SSRECH message. This
       message gives for each period of insurance the scheme, nature and
       type of the period (if relevant), the dates related to the period
       and, eventually, the employment and employer during this period.
