0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Dangerous goods
       recapitulation message (DGRECA) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to specify recapitulations pertaining to the dangerous
       goods on board of a means of transport, e.g. a vessel.

1.2    Field of application

       The Dangerous goods recapitulation message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message has been designed to enable control of pollution caused
       by a means of transport, e.g. in the maritime and port environment.
       
       * The message relates to one means of transport.
       
       * The message contains summary information of all dangerous goods on
       board of the means of transport.
       
       * Summary information is given as a recapitulation across all
       consignments on board of the means of transport, for the dangerous
       goods that adhere to a certain combination of IMO code (i.e.
       International Maritime Organisation), IMO page number, UNDG number
       (i.e. United Nations Dangerous Goods number) and flashpoint.
       
       Business area: control of pollution by a means of transport (e.g.
       maritime pollution)
       
       Sending function: authority (e.g. port), centralised database of
       authorities
       
       Receiving function: authority, search and rescue organisation.
