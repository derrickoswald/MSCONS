0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Equipment damage
       and repair estimate message (DESTIM) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message for use by the container repair, shipping and leasing
       industry. It may be used by a container equipment repair depot to
       send an owner or user a description of damages to the equipment, as
       an estimate of the repair actions and costs needed to rectify such
       damages. A recipient owner may forward the estimate to a lessee. The
       message may also be used by an owner or lessee as an authorization
       message to the repair depot to perform the repairs indicated in the
       estimate, and as an acknowledgment of his willingness to pay for
       those repairs indicated in the estimate for his account.

1.2    Field of application

       The Equipment damage and repair estimate message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       It is envisaged that the Equipment Damage and Repair Estimate
       Message may be used as follows:
       
       1. By an equipment depot to the owner or lessee of damaged equipment
       after the equipment has been returned by a lessee, in order to
       indicate needed repairs and to request authorization to perform
       repair work.
       
       2. By an equipment owner to a lessee to provide repair cost
       estimates, and to request the lessee's acknowledgment of willingness
       to pay costs allocated to lessee's account.
       
       3. By an equipment owner or lessee to a repair depot to give
       authorization to have the damaged equipment repaired.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
