0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Order status
       report message (OSTRPT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message between a buyer or buyer's agent and a seller or seller's
       agent reporting status information on the current status of a
       previously sent order(s). This may be a reply to an order status
       enquiry or a report as agreed between the partners.

1.2    Field of application

       The Order status report message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message covers one seller and one buyer and may relate to:
       
       - one enquiry
       
       - one or more purchase orders
       
       - specific lines within purchase orders
       
       The status can not trigger any action by the receiver of the
       message. For example, if the status is 'ready for shipment', it can
       not be used as a despatch advice information. A DESADV message, or
       an equivalent document, has to be sent as well.
       
       This message can only be used to provide status information.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       - All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing
       the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks,
       months, etc.)
       
       - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible. 
       
       - Conditional data that is required in the message should be
       omitted.
       
       - Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger
       segment of a group.
       
       - Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.

                    other, thus only the coded ID is required, but the
                    consignee or delivery address may vary and would have
                    to be clearly specified, preferably in structured
