0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Party information
       message (PARTIN) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to enable the transmission of basic information regarding
       locations and the related operational, administrative, financial,
       manufacturing, confirmation of registration and trading data.

1.2    Field of application

       The Party information message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The accurate and unambiguous identification of the trading partners
       and their operational parameters is an essential issue for EDI.
       
       The Party Information Message serves to maintain the partners master
       data files.
       
       Note: Once the data available in master data files is established: 
       - identifying codes should be used instead of clear data 
       - clear data is to be used if it is required to override the data
       from a particular transaction.
       
       The Party Information Message is used to specify information related
       to physical locations and to functional locations. A functional
       location is usually a specific department within a company.
       
       The change, delete, add indicator being given in the BGM segment,
       one separate message has to be provided per type of function
       required.

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section


       Information to be provided in the Header section:

00010   UNH, Message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Party information message is PARTIN.

        Note: Party information messages conforming to this document must
        contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

        Data element  0065 PARTIN
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A
                      0051 UN

00020   BGM, Beginning of message
        A segment for unique identification of the Document name and
        number.
        The message function code (DE 1225) applies to all transactions
        indicated in the message. Consequently, one separate message has to
        be provided per type of function required.
        The following rules apply: 
        - Addition (DE 1225 = 2). This code is used for providing
        information about parties for the first time to the trading
        partner.
        - Deletion (DE 1225 = 3). This code is used to delete parties from
        the partner's master file; In case of deletion, only the NAD
        segments need to be sent in the detail section.
        - Change (DE 1225 = 4). This code is used to modify any information
        relevant to parties already known by the trading partner. All the
        segments relating to the party including the address to be modified
        need to be sent.
        - Confirmation (DE 1225 = 6). This code is used when party
        information is sent again for confirmation.

        A segment with free text information, in coded or clear form, used
        when additional information is needed but cannot be accommodated
        within other segments. In computer to computer exchanges such text
        will normally require the receiver to process this segment
        manually.
