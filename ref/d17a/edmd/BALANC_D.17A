0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Balance message
       (BALANC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between
       trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message used to exchange enterprise related balances between the
       enterprise and whoever may use them for the purpose of accounting,
       auditing, cost accounting, consolidation, financial analysis, etc.

1.2    Field of application

       The Balance message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The accounting and auditing partners of an enterprise require
       accounting information, most of which is of a common nature. In
       order, therefore, to cope with the practice, an enterprise (parent
       company, subsidiary, division, etc.), a service bureau, a chartered
       accountant or an auditor - referred to as a sender - may transmit
       balances to the various parties involved - known as recipients -
       such as another enterprise (parent company, subsidiary, division,
       etc.), another service bureau, another chartered accountant or
       another auditor. The trial balance is based on the accounting
       entries reflecting the activity of the enterprise and the chart of
       accounts. It enables the preparation of the financial statements.
       The term balance is taken to mean an accounting document that for a
       given period, consists of a list of all accounts from the same
       accounting system. Each account indicates debit or credit total
       amounts in local and foreign currencies. The balance can be
       transmitted at a given moment for control purposes. The message
       BALANC contains information concerning a balance for a given period.
       The frequency of this message ranges from daily to annually.
