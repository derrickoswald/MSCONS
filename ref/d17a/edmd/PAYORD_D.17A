0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Payment order
       message (PAYORD) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Payment Order is sent by the Ordering Customer (or Payor or Agent
       on behalf of the Ordering Customer) to the Ordered Bank, to instruct
       the Ordered Bank to debit an account it services for the Ordering
       Customer, and to arrange for the payment of a specified amount to
       the Beneficiary (or Payee or Agent in favour of Beneficiary) in
       settlement of the referenced business transaction(s). Throughout
       this document, the term 'Ordering Customer' refers to either an
       Ordering Customer, or a Payor or Agent acting on behalf of the
       Ordering Customer; likewise the term 'Beneficiary' refers to either
       a Beneficiary, or a Payee or Agent acting on behalf of the
       Beneficiary.

1.2    Field of application

       The Payment order message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       This message may be applied for both national and international
       settlements.

1.3    Principles

       A Payment Order may cover the financial settlement of one or more
       commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit notes, debit
       notes, etc. It is not intended for use in securities trading.
       
       The Ordered Bank may need a confirmation/authorization to be able to
       process the Payment Order Message, if the payment order(s) is (are)
       sent by a third party.
