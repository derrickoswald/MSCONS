General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Product inquiry
       message (PROINQ) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message enabling the sender to inquire on a product or a group of
       products from a master product catalogue or file according to
       criteria defined in the message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Product inquiry message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message usually relates to a manufacturer and/or a supplier of
       goods and a buyer, or their respective agents.
       
       The buyer may specify in the message the attributes of a product or
       group of products for which additional information is required. This
       will allow a manufacturer and/or supplier to send the requester only
       information for those products the requester is specifically
       interested in rather than the entire product catalogue.
       
       The Product inquiry message may request information in order to:
       
       - select a specific group or family or products from a supplier
       entire product catalogue, e.g. a buyer requesting a supplier of
       medical equipment all product information related to sterilized
       products.
       
       - select a product or group of products according to attributes or
       product characteristics as defined by the sender in the message,
       e.g. a retailer requesting a clothing manufacturer to send product
       information for all blue, white or stripped men's shirts, sizes
       medium to extra-large.
       
       - determine the availability, lead-time and/or general commercial
       and/or sales conditions for a specific product.
       
       The response to a product inquiry message will be either a
       Price/sales catalogue (PRICAT) or Product data message (PRODAT).
       
       PROINQ shall not be used to request a code.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       - All specified dates and/or times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format.
       
       - Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months,
       etc.).
       
       - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       - Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       - Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger
       segment of a group.

4.1.1  Header section


       Information to be provided in the Header section:

00010   UNH, Message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Product inquiry message is PROINQ.

        Note: Product inquiry messages conforming to this document must
        contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

        Data element  0065 PROINQ
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A
                      0051 UN

00020   BGM, Beginning of message
        A segment by which the sender must uniquely identify the Product
        inquiry message by means of its number.

00030   DTM, Date/time/period
        A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
        related to the whole message. The Product Inquiry message
        preparation date must be specified using this segment.

00040   CUX, Currencies
        A segment identifying the currency in which all product prices are
        expressed in the Product inquiry message.

           A segment identifying names and addresses of the parties, in
           coded or clear form, and their functions relevant to the Product
           inquiry message. Identification of the requesting party and the
           party asked for information is mandatory for the Product inquiry
           message. It is recommended that where possible only the coded
           form of the party ID should be specified e.g. the sender and
           receiver of the report are known to each other, thus only the
           coded ID is required, but when a new address might have to be
           clearly specified, this should be done preferably in structured
           format.

           size, pattern (AND linkage).
           Repeating CCI segments provide a choice of characteristic values
           (OR linkage).

00160         CCI, Characteristic/class id
              A segment to identify a product characteristic and/or the
