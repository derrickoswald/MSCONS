General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Authorization
       message (AUTHOR) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An Authorization Message is sent by the Ordering Customer (or Payor
       or Agent on behalf of the Ordering Customer) or by a third party
       having authority on the Ordering Customer's payments to the Ordered
       Bank, to authorize the Ordered Bank to execute a given financial
       transaction.
       
       This financial transaction might relate to both multiple messages
       like PAYMUL and DIRDEB, and single instruction messages like PAYORD
       and PAYEXT.
       
       An Authorization Message could also be sent from the Ordered Bank to
       the Ordering Customer or its Authorization Authority to request
       authorization for a given financial transaction.
       
       Throughout this document the term 'Original Message' refers to the
       message to be authorized.

1.2    Field of application

       The Authorization message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - The authorization carried by the message applies to the whole
       original message (i.e. to all instructions within the message) or to
       individual debit transactions and their related credits.
       
       -  The AUTHOR message may also authorize a single transaction in a
       multiple direct debit transaction.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles applying to the message are
       intended to facilitate the understanding of the message.
       
       The Authorization message is structured in three levels: A, B, and
       C.
       
       Level A Segment Groups 1, 2, 3 and 9 contains general data related
       to the whole message.
       
       Level B Segment Groups 4 and 5 contains data identifying the message
       or transaction to be authorized.
       
       Level C Segment Groups 6 to 8 contains the authorization.
       
       The structure of the message is designed to allow several B levels,
       each B level being followed by its related C levels.
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
