General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Utilities master
       data message (UTILMD) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Utilities master data message is sent between responsible
       parties in a utilities infrastructure for the purpose of exchanging
       characteristics of objects and services. In addition the Utilities
       master data message may be used to request information.
       
       A party in a utilities infrastructure can for example be a net
       owner, a supplier, a balance responsible or a transmission system
       operator.

1.2    Field of application

       The Utilities master data message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The Utilities master data message is used for exchanging
       characteristics of objects and services in the specified field,
       normally used for updating data bases with administrative and
       technical information of long validity, such as information
       concerning customers, partners and installations. The information
       may be of technical or administrative character, such as
       characteristics of a meter, tariffs, suppliers etc.
       
       In addition the Utilities master data message may be used to request
       information.
        
       Each set of master data can be identified according to its nature,
       e.g. by a metering point identification or a location
       identification. The message may be an initial message and does not
       require a response.
       
       Examples of use are:
        Information regarding change of supplier, such as:
        Request for end user information.
        Information regarding the characteristics of an end user. 
        Information about change of supplier.
        Information of contract termination from an end user.
        Exchange of changes in characteristics of objects or services
       between parties in a utilities infrastructure.
        Change of identity of an object.
        Change of components or characteristics of components, such as
       change of a meter.

       will normally contain information of long validity.
