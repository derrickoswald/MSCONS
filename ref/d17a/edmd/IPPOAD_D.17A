0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Insurance policy
       administration message (IPPOAD) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Insurance policy administration message is exchanged between
       insurers, insurance intermediaries, clients and third parties for
       the purpose of policy administration. It covers the administration
       of a policy from initial placing, through adjustment and renewal to
       cancellation as well as providing policy declarations to third
       parties.

1.2    Field of application

       The Insurance policy administration message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message should contain information relating to a single
       insurance contract (which may be a single policy or a group of
       policies under one contract number), although this contract may have
       more than one insurer (co-insurance).
       
       The message may contain many business transactions but all must
       relate to a single contract.
       
       The message is used for all transaction types in either dialogue
       (request for and provision of policy details) or notification (after
       the event) processing.
       
       The structure of IPPOAD is based upon the insurance sub-working
       group insurance underwriting data model. The major entities in the
       data model form the core segment groups. These groups are for the
       policy contract (triggered by the Insurance cover description
       segment), parties (triggered by the Party name segment), insurance
       objects (triggered by the Risk object description segment), and
       events and activities (triggered by the Event segment) and are
       positioned at the top level in the message structure.
       
       When processing a policy transaction a series of input 'components'
       associated with the major entities are processed. For example, when
       the insurance object is a premises then information on its
       construction is required, when the object is a vehicle then
       information on its security devices is required. As a result of the
       transaction a series of output 'components' is derived, for example,
       covers and premiums. These input and output components are carried
       in a group of segments triggered by component details, where a coded
       qualifier identifies the type of component. The component details
       component group is positioned hierarchically below each of the major
       entity groups in the message.
       
       Below each of the component groups a group of segments, triggered by
       premium calculation component, is positioned. The premium
       calculation component groups provide details of the components used
       to calculate the premiums and derive the covers for the main
       entities, for example, loadings, discounts, excesses, endorsements,
       conditions.
       
       Other top level groups that complete the message structure are
       triggered by the sequence details segment - to provide details of
       the insurance history (previous policies) for the risk and the
       payment terms segment - to provide payment details.
       
       Although the major entities are linked hierarchically to their input
       and output components and the premium calculation components there
       is also a requirement to link the entities relationally across the
       message structure, for example, parties (drivers) to objects
       (vehicles). To achieve the links each group has an Identity segment
       positioned as the first segment inside the group that contains a
       unique identification number. These identification numbers may then
       appear inside other groups as 'foreign keys' to provide the
       relational links. They may also be used to provide 'parent child'
       relationships; for example, a parent object of a premises may
       contain a child object of a freezer.
