0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the General purpose
       message (GENRAL) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to enable the transmission of textual information.

1.2    Field of application

       The General purpose message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message:
       - may be used to send general application support information to one
       or multiple addresses.
       
       - may be used to send required data for which there is no specific
       standard message.
       
       - MUST not be used as a substitute for an existing UNSM under
       development, under trial or at approved status. Nor should it be
       used to avoid the development of a more specific application
       message.
       
       - is not designed or intended to be used as a replacement for
       existing electronic mail systems.
       
       The GENRAL message was designed primarily to
       
       . facilitate early transmission testing between new EDI partners;
       
       . broadcasting of known problem areas to EDI partners;
       
       . transmission of text (preferably structured or coded) to
       supplement or further clarify previously transmitted EDI standard
       messages, e.g. to stress that provision data is for test purposes
       only contains known errors to test out error routines.
       
       . transmission of small amounts of structured text where no existing
       messages exist, e.g. computer listings.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'yymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken to ensure that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger
       segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
