0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Repair call
       message (RPCALL) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message sent by a manufacturer or a call centre with information
       addressed to servicing and repair centres with details of appliances
       requiring repair or service. The information provided by the
       manufacturer or a call centre may include, details of the appliance,
       symptoms and faults, service history and previous repairs, parts
       already replaced, location where the appliance it is to be found as
       well as contact details.

1.2    Field of application

       The Repair call message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The RPCALL message can be used to inform service and repair centres
       on one or more repair calls that are proposed by a manufacturer or a
       call centre.  
       
       The message may contain the following information relating to the
       appliance and its location:
       - the appliance model number or type
       - warranty details (as relevant)
       - symptoms and defect codes
       - repair history (as relevant)
       - address where the appliance is to be found and contact details
       - date and time requested for the visit
       
       The PROSRV message may be used to respond to the manufacturer or
       call centre indicating the details of the interventions.

       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines apply to the whole message and are intended
       to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message: 
              
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.). 
              
       Where a choice of code or text is given, the code element should be
       used wherever possible.
              
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
              
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment
       of a group.
              
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
