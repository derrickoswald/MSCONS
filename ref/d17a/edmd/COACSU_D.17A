0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Commercial account
       summary message (COACSU) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A commercial account summary message enables the transmission of
       commercial data concerning payments made and outstanding items on an
       account over a period of time. The message may be sent at specific
       agreed fixed intervals or on demand, and may be sent to and, or,
       from trading parties and, or, their authorised agents.

1.2    Field of application

       The Commercial account summary message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A commercial account summary may:
       - refer to invoices, credit notes, debit notes, or payments over a
       period of time.
       - refer to only one account, in one currency.
       - be initiated at any time by a party, depending upon agreement
       between the parties involved.
       - provide information on an account over a period of time. When the
       message is used in this way both payments made and amounts
       outstanding may be detailed.
       - may contain additional information for customs and/or statistical
       purposes/services.
       - be used as a reminder of payment due for the current accounting
       period.
       - be used as a request for payment of outstanding invoices and
       detail penalties for amounts outstanding from previous accounting
       periods.
       - be used in the reconciliation of accounts when detailing payments
       made.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding an implementation
       of the message:
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when additional
       information that cannot be accommodated within the other segments is
       required.
