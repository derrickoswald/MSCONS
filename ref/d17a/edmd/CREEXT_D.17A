       its account has been or will be credited for a specified amount on
       the date indicated, in settlement of the referenced business
       transaction(s), and to provide to the Payee full details of the
       transactions to which the Extended Credit Advice relates.

1.2    Field of application

       The Extended credit advice message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       An Extended Credit Advice may cover the financial settlement of one
       or more commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit
       notes, debit notes, etc. It is not intended for use in securities
