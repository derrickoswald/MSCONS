0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Medical resource
       usage and cost message (MEDRUC) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The MEDRUC message is sent from a party providing medical and
       related administrative services to a funding institution, allowing
       evaluation of the medical activity and justification for
       reimbursement. It can also be sent from a funding institution to
       another party in order to advise which reimbursements have been
       made.
       
       The MEDRUC message can carry either initial specifications of used
       resources and costs, or modifications to specifications given in a
       previous message.
       
       Typically, the MEDRUC message can be used between a healthcare
       service provider or an insurance company and another insurance
       company as well as between an insurance company and a healthcare
       service provider.

1.2    Field of application

       The Medical resource usage and cost message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       Particularly, MEDRUC can be applied for all types of healthcare
       service providers, funding institutions and healthcare systems.

1.3    Principles

       The MEDRUC message has a hierarchical structure:
       - One message can carry one or more reimbursement claims.
       - Each reimbursement claim concerns medical services provided to one
       or several patients.
       - Each medical service gives information about service provided
       including amounts and price information (unit, prices, quantities,
       rates) as well as medical justification for the services provided
       (clinical information concerning diseases or interventions) and
       administrative justification for services provided according to
       insurance coverage.
       - Each medical service can consist of none, one or many detailed
       medical activities.
       - Each detailed medical activity can contain the same information
       elements as for a medical service.
       
       Additional information can be attached to each level of the
       hierarchical structure using an internal reference mechanism. This
       information may include:
       - medical, administrative and financial parties involved.
       - relevant insurance contracts and corresponding rights.
       - description of patient or healthcare service provider
       transportation.
