0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Receiving advice
       message (RECADV) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message is to address the business needs related to the goods
       receipt. This message is used to report the physical receipt of
       goods. The message allows for the reporting of discrepancies in
       products, quantities, terms, packages, etc.
       
       The message may contain only the information that the received
       consignment is completely in line with the consignment information
       given in the Despatch advice message. In case there is no detail to
       be provided.
       
       The message may inform about the discrepancies:
       - between the received consignment and consignment information given
       in the Despatch advice message.
       - between the received goods and the ordered goods in the ORDERS,
       DELFOR or DELJIT information.

1.2    Field of application

       The Receiving advice message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message is initiated by the party which received the goods. The
       message relates to a single or to multiple receiving points. It may
       cover a number of different items or packages.

2.     REFERENCES

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 1.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format.
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months,
       etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Care must be taken to avoid the conflicting use of qualifiers.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
