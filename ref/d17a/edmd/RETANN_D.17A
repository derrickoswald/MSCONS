0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Announcement for
       returns message (RETANN) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message by which a party announces to another party details of
       goods for return due to specified reasons (e.g. returns for repair,
       returns at end of leasing period, returns because of damage).

1.2    Field of application

       The Announcement for returns message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may be used by the message sender to request credit for
       goods, or the replacement of goods from the message recipient.
       
       This message should stimulate the message recipient to instruct on
       how the named goods should be returned, destroyed, or disposed of.
       
       In the case where the recipient of the announcement refuses to
       accept the return of goods the sender would expect to receive
       notification of this decision and also instructions on what should
       happen instead of the return. This process will usually be handled
       using the Instruction for Return message.
       
       The announcement for returns can be used by a party to inform
       another party on the requested return of:
       
       -    goods received in bad condition;
       -    goods received but not ordered;
       -    goods for repair;
       -    goods which have to be returned due to the end of a leasing
       contract;
       -    goods which have exceeded their expiry date without being sold;
       -    goods on commission;
       -    goods from sale on approval;
       -    sale or return goods;
       -    returnable transport or packaging containers;
       -    obsolete goods.
       
       The announcement for returns may be used to return received goods
       for which receipt of delivery may already have been acknowledged by
       way of the Receiving Advice message (where this message is being
       used), e.g., the faulty goods are only discovered on opening a
       container for which a receiving advice has been issued.
       
       The announcement for returns may also be used to specify additional
       information regarding the return of goods such as handling
       instructions or hazardous material information.
       
       The recipient of the announcement for returns is requested to decide
       the final disposition of the goods for return:
       
       -    whether the goods shall be returned, repaired, destroyed, or
       disposed of;
       -    which transport means and mode should be used;
       -    on or by which date the return should take place;
       -    which party is responsible for the cost of return.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd' /'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when additional
       information that cannot be accommodated within the other segments is
       required.
