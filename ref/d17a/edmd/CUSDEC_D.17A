General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Customs
       declaration message (CUSDEC) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This Customs Declaration Message (CUSDEC) permits the transfer of
       data from a declarant to a customs administration for the purpose of
       meeting legislative and/or operational requirements in respect of
       the declaration of goods for import, export or transit. The message
       may also be used, for example :
       
        - to transmit data from an exporter in one country to an importer
       in another country; 
        - to transmit consignment data from one customs administration to
       another;
        - to transmit data from a customs authority to other governments
       agencies and/or interested administrations.
       - to transmit data from a declarant to the appropriate data
       collection agency on the movement of goods between statistical
       territories.

1.2    Field of application

       The Customs declaration message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message incorporates the necessary transport, statistical and
       customs information. Provision has also been made for the inclusion
       of appropriate commercial information which may be accepted by
       customs in lieu of supporting documentation.
       
       The design principles adopted allow for referencing one or more
       commercial documents pertaining to the same declaration and for the
       grouping of document lines into a single customs item. A customs
       item consists of the grouping of those document lines having the
       same customs characteristics (e.g. tariff number, declared use,
       etc.). The message correspondingly permits the use of single or
       multi-packaging concepts and their identification to a customs item.
