0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Documentary credit
       advice message (DOCADV) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Documentary Credit Advice message is used to indicate to the
       Beneficiary the terms and conditions of a documentary credit that
       has been originated by the Issuing Bank and received by the Advising
       Bank (or an Intermediary Advising Bank).

1.2    Field of application

       The Documentary credit advice message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Unless otherwise specified, the documentary credit is issued subject
       to the Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits,
       International Chamber of Commerce, Paris, France, which are in
       effect on the date of issue.
