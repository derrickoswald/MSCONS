0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Purchase order
       message (ORDERS) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

1.2    Field of application

       The Purchase order message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A buyer may order for one or more goods items or services.
       
       - A purchase order may refer to goods items or services related to
       one or more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.
       
       - A purchase order for cross-border transactions may contain
       additional information for customs and/or statistical purposes.
       
       - A purchase order may contain details for transport and destination
       as well as delivery patterns.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.

        to the whole of the Order and, if no schedule is to be specified,
        the delivery date.
        The Date/time/period segment within other Segment group should be
        used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically related

        within the PYT Segment group.

00040   PAI, Payment instructions
        A segment requesting or confirming conditions of payment, guarantee
        and method of payment for the whole order. An example of the use of

        line items.

           the coded form of the party ID should be specified e.g. The
           Buyer and Seller are known to each other, thus only the coded ID
           is required, but the Consignee or Delivery address may vary and
