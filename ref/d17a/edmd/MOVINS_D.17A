0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Stowage
       instruction message (MOVINS) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Stowage instruction message contains details of one means of
       transport vehicle, giving instructions regarding the loading,
       discharging and restowage of equipment and/or cargoes and the
       location on the means of transport where the operation must take
       place.

1.2    Field of application

       The Stowage instruction message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       In the shipping industry the Stowage instruction message can be used
       between partners involved in the loading and discharging of vessels
       and other means of transport, like stevedores, shipping lines,
       tonnage centres, etc..
