General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Notification of
       registration of a worker message (SSREGW) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The SSREGW message is exchanged between designated bodies to enable
       interchange and registration of a worker's social security number.
       The message is also exchanged by designated bodies to request and
       compile details of worker's social security insurance record.

1.2    Field of application

       The Notification of registration of a worker message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The SSREGW message is used for several purposes :
       
       1 - it is sent by the designated body of one State to the equivalent
       body of another State to advise that a national of the latter State
       has registered for Social Security purposes in the former State and
       to advise the Social Security number allocated to him.
       
       2 - it is sent by the designated body which received a SSREGW
       message of the former type to acknowledge receipt of this message
       and to advise or confirm the registration number of the worker.
       
       3 - it is sent by the designated body of one State to the equivalent
       body of another State to request details of a worker's Social
       Security insurance record in the latter State.
       
       4 - it is sent by the designated body in the State of the worker's
       nationality to equivalent bodies in all other States in which the
       worker has been registered to communicate insurance numbers in other
       states.
