0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Value added tax
       message (VATDEC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This VAT Declaration Message (VATDEC) permits the transfer of data
       from a declarant to a national VAT collecting authority for the
       purpose of meeting legislative and/or operational requirements in
       respect of the declarations of VAT.
       
       The declarant may be a taxpayer who is obliged to send VAT returns
       the authorities, or an accountant or others who on behalf of one
       several taxpayers send VAT returns to the authorities and who is
       mandated to do so by the authorities and the taxpayer.
       
       The declaration may contain one or several returns.
       
       The message may also be used, for example:
       
       - within the European Union, to transmit VAT summary information for
       the Value Added Tax Information Exchange System (VIES) from a
       declarant to the relevant national VIES collecting authorities.
       
       - to transmit other related or comparable VAT information from a
       declarant to the relevant authorities.

1.2    Field of application

       The Value added tax message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message is designed to be as flexible as possible, taking into
       consideration the different needs and practices for the transmission
       of VAT data.
       
       It is expected that most administrations who wish to use this
       message will not require the full structure (i.e. subsets will be
       used).
       Segments which are conditional may be omitted at the discretion of
       the implementor.
