General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Contractual
       conditions message (CNTCND) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message sent by a customer to a supplier and other interested
       parties providing the contractual conditions of a previously
       negotiated contract in order to enable the automatic processing of
       invoices for orders which have been made against the contract or for
       the completion of identified stages within the contract.

1.2    Field of application

       The Contractual conditions message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Contractual conditions message is sent by a customer to a supplier
       and other interested parties in order to inform them of the
       contractual conditions which will be used in the validation of
       orders and in the verification of invoices prior to payment. 
       This message is typically used in the case where a general contract
       has been established between the customer and the supplier against
       which goods will be ordered over a period of time on an order by
       order basis. The contract will have been previously negotiated and
       accepted. This message only contains the information that can be
       used in automatically approving the issuance of an order or the
       correctness of an invoice. It is not intended to contain the
       totality of the contractual information.
