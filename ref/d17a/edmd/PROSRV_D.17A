0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Product service
       message (PROSRV) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message providing the information and details to enable servicing
       and repair centres to report to manufacturers on repairs and other
       services carried out on products and appliances. The message
       provides details for claims under guaranty or contract to be
       reimbursed.
       
       The information transmitted gives details of the claimant,
       manufacturer and seller. It may give details of the purchaser of the
       product. It can identify the product and specify the date it was
       purchased and delivered, can specify the problem and describe the
       labour, parts used and costs incurred in the repair of the product.
       The message may also be used by the manufacturer or his agent to
       respond to the claimant.

1.2    Field of application

       The Product service message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The PROSRV message can be used to report on multiple claims, or may
       be used in respect of a single claim.
       
       The message will contain information relevant to whether the claim
       is covered by warranty or not.
       
       The repair or service centre will indicate the details of any
       repairs undertaken.
       
       The details of the repairs may include symptoms and defect
       identification codes, parts replaced or repaired, charges for
       labour, material, transport and other charges incurred during the
       repair or service of the product.
       
       Each claim will refer to one product. There may be multiple faults
       with the product and multiple parts used in the repair of the
       product.
       
       The details of the ultimate customer, the seller and the time and
       place of purchase may be given per product being repaired.

       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines apply to the whole message and are intended
       to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given, the code element should be
       used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment
       of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.

           only the coded form of the party identification should be
           specified e.g. the manufacturer and repair centre are known to

                 needed but cannot be accommodated within other segments.
                 In computer to computer exchanges such text will normally
                 require the receiver to process this segment manually.
