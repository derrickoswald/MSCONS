0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Reinsurance core
       data message (RECORD) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The RECORD message will convey to partners involved in the placing
       of a reinsurance contract or endorsement in a structured format all
       the required core data that form the basis of the negotiation
       process and of the ensuing contract (such as : contract sections and
       their criteria, clauses, coverages, deductibles, deductions and
       premiums, parties involved).

1.2    Field of application

       The Reinsurance core data message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The RECORD message has been built up from a set of flexible modules
       which allow the specification of the function of the message, the
       contract details, the subdivisions within it and for each, its main
       characteristics (coverages, deductibles, deductions, premiums and
       applicable clauses), the party(ies) involved with tier involvement,
       special conditions and the response to them. The message can either
       be used in a "minimalist" manner - in which case only few data need
       to be provided (e.g. when first submitting a risk or when declining
       a risk), or in a "maximalist" way - in which case all applicable
       data can be provided (normally towards the end of the placing
       process). In addition to these business functions, the RECORD also
       links or points to various types of supporting documentation
       requested or available to supplement the EDI document.
       
       RECORD is one of a complimentary pair of messages that support the
       placing of reinsurance business. RECORD carries the core business
       data related to the contract, whilst RELIST carries the list of
       items covered under the terms of the contract.
       
       1.3.1 Scope and composition
       
       The RECORD message performs multiple functions in the placing
       process, and therefore consists of a set of flexible components
       which can either be switched on or off - depending on the type of
       transaction within a specified scenario. These components include:
       
       - a header that allows to identify the transaction function, to
       reference the reinsurance contract version with its relevant data,
       and the parties involved in the transaction;
       
       - a group that allows to identify contractual or section criteria
       (class of business, type of peril, type of activity, location,
       clauses, currencies, etc.) and other characteristics (period, type
       of cover, etc.);
       
       - the major subgroup within this section allows to identify
       coverages, deductibles, premiums, deductions and other relevant
       provisions per section or for the whole contract. Each can be either
       expressed as an amount, a rate, a quantity (e.g. number of lines,
       number of reinstatements) or a duration (e.g. indemnity duration),
       and they can be linked to more specific sub-criteria (e.g. a section
       for class of business 'aviation', with coverages relating to
       'luggage', 'passenger liability', etc.); 
       
       - a further group allows to refer to information that supports the
       placement process and that is either related to the whole contract
       or to one or more sections in it; it can be used both to request and
       to supply additional information.
       
       - the last major information component in the RECORD contains party
       information; here again, multiple functions are foreseen:
       
       a) rendering of information about the parties involved in the
       original policy (policy holder, insurer, co-insurers, broker);
       
       b) rendering of information about the parties involved in the
       reinsurance contract (brokers, reinsurers); this functionality is
       sometimes referred to as the 'market list', and it is mainly used by
       brokers to inform cedents of the progress of the placement
       (reinsurers with share and conditions); at the end of the placing
       process, this list becomes the final placement list. Such a list can
       however perform others functions as well: a cedent may supply it to
       the broker as his 'preferred marketing list', a broker may present
       it to the cedent as his 'proposed marketing list', a cedent or
       broker may include it in his offer to reinsurers to show which other
       reinsurers have already signed on, etc. For this functionality, a
       small group with market specific details needs to be used.
       
       c) an interesting aspect is that it is possible to report on
       'composites' of reinsurers and their decomposition: a 'pool' with
       all its partners, a 'stamp' with the reinsurers behind it, a broker
       in a foreign market with the reinsurers that have signed via him,
       etc.
       
       d) requesting a participation from a party - either as an amount, a
       percentage, a quantity (e.g. number of lines) or as a mixture of
       them; various options exist here: either only the format is
       expressed, the expected participation is given or a minimum-maximum
       range is offered. Additionally, previous written and signed lines
       can be specified for information.
       
       e) responding to an offer - either by a quotation or an order which
       may either be conditional or unconditional; in case of a conditional
       order, a set of conditions can be specified for each potential order
       (e.g. I take 8% if condition A & B are fulfilled or 6% if only
       condition B is fulfilled).
       
       f) responding to conditions; this is primarily done by quoting back
       the condition reference, supplemented with free text or by resending
       a new offer package with the condition references attached and a
       flag 'condition met' against each.
       
       
       1.3.2 Functions covered
       
       The functions that the RECORD currently caters for are:

       endorsement cycle: 
       - endorsement request
       - cancellation notice - provisional
       - cancellation notice - definite
       - decline endorsement request
       - (unconditional) acceptance of endorsement request
       - conditional acceptance of endorsement request
       - endorsement notice
       - request to negotiate endorsement
       - decline all conditions
       - withdrawal notice of cancellation
       - advice cancellation method

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

3.2    Message terms and definitions

       Introduction
       
       'Placing' is basically the term used for the whole negotiation cycle
       to get a risk or a set of risks reinsured in the form of a
       reinsurance contract. As this process is identical to the
       endorsement cycle (whereby modifications to a contract such as
       extensions in time, in number or value of risks to be covered, in
       special conditions go through a negotiation cycle), this cycle has
       also been included in the placing process. Some other similar
       business cycles such as the cancellation, renewal have equally been
       covered.
       
       The placing process is essentially not different from any buyer-
       supplier bidding process, although this simple fact is too often
       dissimulated behind complex procedures and specific terminology: the
       objective of the process is to find 'suppliers' that are acceptable
       for the buyer and that meet his requirements.
       
       In this sense, the RECORD message could be used by any other
       industry in which a contract is negotiated. 
       
       Placing sub-processes
       
       Bidding round 1: the process is initiated by the prospective buyer
       who composes a package that consists of his tentative requirements
       along with any information that may help the prospective supplier to
       make his bid. This additional documentation may take any form and
       may comprise statistics, plans, bidding terms, original policy
       documentation, etc. This 'package' is transmitted to selected
       potential suppliers for a first bidding round. This sub-process is
       closed off upon reception of the bids from the suppliers. It is
       generally referred to as the 'quotation stage'.
       
       Bidding round 2: the buyer has at this point two options: either he
       has received one or more firm bids that fulfil his requirements, in
       which case he confirms the acceptability of the bids to the relevant
       supplier(s); or else he uses the received bids to re-formulate his
       requirements, thus initiating a second bidding round.
       
       This second round - generally referred to as the 'order' stage -
       follows essentially the same pattern as the quotation stage, and it
       may very well be the only stage in the placing process; this is e.g.
       the case when a contract is renewed without obtaining a quotation
       first.
       
       The process is closed off when the order offer is either accepted or
       rejected - possibly after more bidding or negotiation rounds.
       
       The process may consist of a double loop instead of a single one in
       case the buyer requests another party (broker) to perform the
       placing process on his behalf; again, there is no essential
       difference: the buyer will first select in an initial bidding
       process the party to which he wishes to confer this duty.
       Afterwards, the process continues as described above with an
       additional feed-back loop from the broker to the buyer. 
       
       The endorsement process
       
       The endorsement process is the one that is used to agree any type of
       change to the originally agreed contract; this may range from simple
       period extensions or cancellations to quite complex process types
       such as mid-term market changes. The process may be such that one
       type of endorsement request leads to another type of endorsement
       (e.g. a request for change in conditions may lead to a market
       change).
       
       The endorsement process largely follows the same pattern as the
       placing process: the buyer (or supplier) requests the change from
       the other party, who in one or more discussion rounds agrees or
       refuses.
       
       Main parties involved
       
       - Cedent/ceding company/reinsured/retrocedent
       
       The insurance or reinsurance company that seeks protection against a
       risk in the form of reinsurance or retrocession buying; hence the
       term 'buyer' is sometimes equally used; where the cedent is a
       reinsurer who retrocedes (i.e. re-sells) accepted business, the term
       'retroceding company' is more commonly used - but the flows are
       identical, and therefore both are considered in the underlying
       document.
       
       - Reinsurer
       
       Company supplying reinsurance protection for agreed terms and
       conditions (the terms 'underwriter' and 'assuming company' are
       equally covered by this definition); if the reinsurer protects risks
       coming from another reinsurer, the flow is called 'retrocession'.
       Apart from these terms, there is little or no difference between the
       flow for 'cession' or 'retrocession' placing.
       
       - Broker
       
       Intermediary between cedent and reinsurer. His function in the
       placing flows is essentially to ensure that a contract or
       endorsement with acceptable terms and conditions for the required
       cover is established, and that acceptable reinsurers are found to
       take part. Additionally, he will establish and facilitate the
       communication between the parties involved in the placing process.
       In return, he is paid a part of the premium that the cedent pays to
       the reinsurer, called the 'brokerage'.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.

00010   UNH, Message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Reinsurance core data message is RECORD.

        Note: Reinsurance core data messages conforming to this document
        must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

        Data element  0065 RECORD
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A
                      0051 UN

00020   BGM, Beginning of message
        To indicate the type of message, its function and its identifying
        reference.

00030   DTM, Date/time/period
        To specify dates and times relating to the transaction and to the
        process stage. The 'transaction creation date and time' and the
        'contract version date and time' are required. The use of the other
        values depends on the type of transaction.

00040   AGR, Agreement identification
        A segment primarily used to specify the placing stage (i.e.
        quotation, order, endorsement) and - in case of an endorsement -
        the endorsement type. It can also be used to give some high- level
        indicators regarding the nature of the risk (e.g. contract type).

00050   RFF, Reference
        The segment must be used to specify the risk reference: this is the
        key reference that the risk will carry from the start to finish
        throughout each of the cycles - supplemented with the placing stage
        type and the contract version date/time stamp which can both
        change. Other references that may be specified at this level
        include: the 'link reference' which links this specific placement
        to the placement of one or more other contracts (required to
        indicate that a previous contract is renewed as a set of linked
        contracts); the 'password access reference' which may be required
        in some implementations to access the risk data; the 'authorising
        market reference' which is required in some implementations of the
        endorsement process (London practice only).

00060   GEI, Processing information
        Used to specify at header level whether information has been
        modified. If both underlying policy and contract have the same
        data, then there is no need to specify all the insurance policy
        data: they are simply listed under the reinsurance contract, and a
        flag here indicates this fact. The segment can equally be used to
        indicate - specifically for an endorsement - if the data need to be
        made available to the bureau members (London practice only). The
        'reason for declining' can be specified here in a coded format.
        A further code can be used to identify the character of the
        transaction. Lastly, codes can be used to indicate the scope of the
        requested common account protection.

00070   FTX, Free text
        Mainly used to specify the reason of the transaction in textual
        format. Additionally, it can be used to specify the contract name
        and to explain the nature of the revision or the endorsement. Even
        though the message allows for text, it should be used sparsely.


00080   Segment group 1:  PNA-BUS-RFF-SG2
        This group must be used to specify sender and receiver.
        Additionally and when relevant, the information originator and
        third parties receiving a copy of the message can equally be
        specified.

00090      PNA, Party identification
           To specify the sender and receiver of the transaction, and
           optionally third parties such as the information originator (in
           case the message is simply passed on) and courtesy copy
           receivers.

00100      BUS, Business function
           To describe the business function of the party named.

00110      RFF, Reference
           To specify contract references for the party named. In case of
           placement or endorsement of a single contract, the contract
           reference will be specified. In case of a process that involves
           a group of contracts (in reinsurance terms: set of layers or
           bouquet), the contract group reference will be specified. In
           case of renewal, the previous contract reference(s) need to be
           specified. The original policy reference will only be used in
           case of a facultative (i.e. individual risk) placement whereby
           the policy details are not given as they are a subset of the
           contract data. The parent contract reference is specified when a
           declaration is placed. A reference may equally be specified in a
           response flow to indicate the reference number of the
           transaction to which this RECORD is a reply or addition.


00120      Segment group 2:  CTA-COM
           This group is used to specify contact persons or departments
           within the named party.

00130         CTA, Contact information
              To specify the contact within the named party.

00140         COM, Communication contact
              To specify the means of communicating with the named party
              contact.


00150   Segment group 3:  IDE-GEI-ICD-RFF-ATT-CUX-FTX-SG4-SG6-SG7-SG8-SG14
        This group is used to perform all basic reporting either at
        contract level or per section, i.e.
        - section criteria for sections; 
        - clauses; 
        - coverages, deductibles, premiums and deductions; 
        - other types of provision (settlement terms, account submission
        terms, deposit use terms, etc.); 
        - parties and their involvement.
        Clarification: The maximum of 99 repeats has been introduced for
        practical reasons, and is to be understood as an overall limit on
        the total number of sections and subsections in any one contract.
        Even though in theory some data could be provided at contract level
        (e.g. commission, brokerage) and others at section level (e.g.
