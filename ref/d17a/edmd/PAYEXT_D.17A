0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Extended payment
       order message (PAYEXT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An Extended Payment Order is sent by the Ordering Customer (or Payor
       or Agent on behalf of the Ordering Customer) to the Ordered Bank, to
       instruct the Ordered Bank to debit an account it services for the
       Ordering Customer, and to arrange for the payment of a specified
       amount to the Beneficiary (or Payee or Agent in favour of
       Beneficiary) in settlement of the referenced business
       transaction(s), and to provide to the Payee full details of the
       transactions to which the Extended Payment Order relates.
       
       Throughout this document, the term 'Ordering Customer' refers to
       either an Ordering Customer, or a Payor or Agent acting on behalf of
       the Ordering Customer; likewise the term 'Beneficiary' refers to
       either a Beneficiary, or a Payee or Agent acting on behalf of the
       Beneficiary.

1.2    Field of application

       The Extended payment order message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       This message may be applied for both national and international
       settlements.

1.3    Principles

       An Extended Payment Order may cover the financial settlement of one
       or more commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit
       notes, debit notes, etc. It is not intended for use in securities
       trading.
       
       The Ordered Bank may need a confirmation/ authorization to be able
       to process the Extended Payment Order Message.
