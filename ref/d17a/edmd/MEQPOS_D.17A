0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Means of transport
       and equipment position message (MEQPOS) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message containing the position of a means of transport (e.g. a
       vessel or truck) and/or equipment related to a means of transport.

1.2    Field of application

       The Means of transport and equipment position message may be used
       for both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       * The message relates to one means of transport and/or equipment
       related to a means of transport.
       
       * The message contains the last reported position of the means of
       transport, e.g. at sea.
       
       * The message contains information on the conveyance of the means of
       transport, possibly including the number of people on board.
       
       Business area: control of pollution by a means of transport (e.g.
       maritime pollution)
       
       Sending function: truck's driver, vessel's master, authority (e.g.
       port, police), centralised database of authorities
       
       Receiving function: authority (e.g. port), search and rescue
       organisation
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
