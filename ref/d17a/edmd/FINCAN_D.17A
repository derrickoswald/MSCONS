0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Financial
       cancellation message (FINCAN) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Financial Cancellation Message is sent by the Ordering Customer
       (or Payor or Agent on behalf of the Ordering Customer) or by a third
       party having authority on the Ordering Customer's payments to the
       Ordered Bank to request cancellation of a given financial message or
       transaction.
       
       Throughout this document: - The term 'Original Message' refers to
       the message to be cancelled (in full or part thereof); the term
       'originator' refers to the sender of the original message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Financial cancellation message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - This message contains one to many cancellation instructions.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles applying to the message are
       intended to facilitate the understanding of the message. 
        
       The Financial Cancellation message is structured in two levels: A
       and B. 
        
       Level A Segment Groups 1, 2, 3 and 6 contains general data related
       to the whole message. 
        
       Level B Segment Groups 4 and 5 contains data identifying the message
       or transaction to be cancelled. 
        
       Where a choice of code or text is given, only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
