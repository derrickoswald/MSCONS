0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Quantity valuation
       message (CONQVA) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Typically, this message will be used for a contractor to submit
       progress details to a client or his representative. The message will
       be used also for subsets of the project where work has been
       contracted out to other parties. In these cases the exchange would
       be between the subcontractor and the party that subcontracted the
       work.

1.2    Field of application

       The Quantity valuation message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The following descriptions refer to the construction industry as an
       example, but do not exclude other business sectors' implementation.

1.3    Principles

       This message is to be used to support the business of exchanging
       progress information for groups of work items which make up a
       construction project.
       
       There are several examples within the construction process where one
       party is required to advise another party about the quantity of work
       performed for a specific time period or since the start of the
       project.
       
       A project may be subdivided into individual groupings of work
       referred to as items and it is against these items that progress
       quantities are reported.
       
       During the design of this message every effort has been made to
       adopt a "generic" approach and it seems possible that other
       industries may find this a suitable message to adopt.
       
       This is only one of a number of messages being designed for the
       Construction industry. This particular message refers to already
       established items of work, these items will be defined at the start
       of a project. Work is well advanced on suitable EDI messages to
       address this part of the process.
       
       Allowance has been made within the CONQVA message for "new" items of
       work. There are a number of reasons why additional items of work
       will occur once a project has started.
       
       Each work item may contain more than one quantity and this has been
       accommodated. An example of this would be the quoting of both a
       cumulative and a "this period" quantity.
