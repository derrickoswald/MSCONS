0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Accounting entries
       message (ENTREC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message used to exchange accounting entries between an enterprise
       and whoever may use them for the purpose of accounting, auditing,
       cost accounting, consolidation, financial analysis, etc.

1.2    Field of application

       The Accounting entries message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The accounting entries may be prepared by an enterprise, a service
       bureau, a chartered accountant or an auditor - referred to as sender
       - for various parties - known as recipients - such as another
       enterprise, another service bureau, another chartered accountant or
       another auditor. 
       
       The accounting entries are reflecting the activity of the
       enterprise. Merged with the chart of accounts, they enable to
       establish the ledger and consequently the trial balance. 
       
       The term accounting entries is taken to mean a set of automated
       accounting records relating to the same event. A computerized
       accounting record is an accounting entry item consisting of several
       logically interrelated data items specifying the value date of an
       amount, its origin, its account concerned, its debit or credit
       amount and its references to the relevant document. 
       
       The message ENTREC contains information concerning a set of entries
       for a given journal and period. The frequency of collected data
       ranges from daily to annually.
