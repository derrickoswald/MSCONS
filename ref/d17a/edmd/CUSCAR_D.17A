General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Customs cargo
       report message (CUSCAR) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message permits the transfer of data from a carrier to a
       Customs administration for the purpose of meeting Customs cargo
       reporting requirements.

1.2    Field of application

       The Customs cargo report message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       It is envisaged that the Customs Cargo Inventory Report Message may
       be initiated by the carrier to report single or multiple
       consignments to a Customs administration. The message is transmitted
       upon arrival of the goods, or where national legislation permits,
       prior to arrival. The data provides Customs with a means of "writing
       off" or acquitting the cargo report against Goods declarations. It
       also allows Customs to undertake selectivity processing in order to
       select high risk shipments requiring examination.
       
       The message may be used for reporting:
       
       (a) onward transit/transhipment;
       (b) short and part shipped goods;
       (c) empty containers;
       (d) import/export cargo;
       (e) house and masterbill relationships
