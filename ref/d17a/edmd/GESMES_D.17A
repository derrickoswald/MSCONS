0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Generic
       statistical message (GESMES) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The compilation of statistics is a continuous chain starting with
       raw data collection, followed by a number of harmonization and
       aggregation processes leading to aggregated statistical data.
       Raw data collection is realized by means of surveys, sampling,
       direct reporting from individuals, economic operators. Harmonization
       and aggregation processes are very often handled by statistical
       bodies or authorized economic operators in case of direct reporting.
       A Generic Statistical Message (GESMES) is used by an organisation
       involved in this elaboration process to transmit a statistical data
       set.
       It permits the transmission of the following, either in the same
       and/or different messages:
       -the statistical concepts comprising the data set and their
       structure
       -if required, all related information ( code sets, labels,
       methodological notes, footnotes, etc.),
       -the statistical figures of the data set.
       This message could be used by producers and users of statistical
       information such as: National Statistical Offices, ministries,
       private and public administrations, private companies etc.

1.2    Field of application

       The Generic statistical message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The structure of statistical information to be exchanged is quite
       simple and could be defined as multidimensional array or
       chronological series. The difficulty of using or exchanging
       statistical data comes the varieties of interpretations of those
       structures. The interpretation varies from one statistical domain to
       another depending on the content.
       Another key factor is the volume: statistical indicators have many
       dimensions (e.g. time, classifications depending on statistical
       nomenclatures), dense and sparse series of matrices could be present
       simultaneously for the same indicator.
       The GESMES message may be used to exchange statistical data for all
       statistical domains in a variety of formats together with their
       descriptions.
       
       The data in the data set (i.e. the array) is contained in a generic
       segment (ARR - Array). The interpretation of the ARR segment is
       provided in segment group 8. GESMES is designed to support all types
       of statistical exchange, including time-series, which can be
       described by means of statistical concepts (i.e. statistical terms
       or objects).
       Associated with statistical data are textual information defining
       comprehensively the series and matrices, the underlying statistical
       concept or methodology. This is often referred to as meta-data and
       corresponds to associated information which is required to interpret
       basic data, such as headlines, stubs, comments and footnotes.
       
       The acronym, GESMES, stands for Generic Statistical Message and
       comprises a number of parts:
       
       i) Identification of administrative information concerning the
       interchange partners (Gr. 2)
       
       ii) Footnotes associated with value lists, statistical concepts and
       data set structures (Gr. 1)
       
       iii) Value lists of coded or non coded items to be used in this
       message or in a future message (Gr. 4)
       
       iv) Definition of statistical concepts to be used in this message or
       in a future message (Gr. 7).
       
       v) Definition of the structure of array data to be used in this
       message or in a future message, and the allocation of a unique
       identity to this definition (Gr. 8).
       
       vi) Identification of one or more data sets (Gr. 11). For each data
       set: the identity of the structure definition to be used to
       interpret the array data (Gr. 12); the scope, value lists or fixed
       values which are local to the data set (Gr. 13 and 14); the array
       data (ARR); footnotes associated with the data set (Gr. 18, 19 and
       20).
