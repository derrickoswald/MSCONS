General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Inspection report
       message (INSRPT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message sent by a customer's inspection service, or his agent,
       informing a supplier and other interested parties of the results of
       the inspection carried out on items due for despatch to a customer.

1.2    Field of application

       The Inspection report message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       An Inspection report message is sent by a customer's inspection
       service, or his agent, to a supplier and other interested parties
       indicating the results of an inspection on items that are due to be
       delivered to a customer. The inspection report indicates whether or
       not the items are in compliance with the reference document and in
       the case of non-compliance, either that the item has to be reworked,
       or the estimated cost of a non-conformity, if the item is not
       compliant but acceptable.
