0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Business credit
       report message (BUSCRD) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Business credit report message is used by credit reporting
       agencies to provide business credit information about a company to
       the agency's trading partners. Business credit information includes,
       but is not limited to, company name(s) or location(s), financial,
       operational, legal and business credit rating information
       
       BUSCRD relates solely to the exchange of corporate or company credit
       information and is intended to enable the automation of business
       decision processing.

1.2    Field of application

       The Business credit report message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       BUSCRD is bi-directional. It can be used by buyers, sellers,
       marketeers, and financial institutions to request from a party
       holding such information, all or part of the credit information of
       an existing or potential trading partner. It can also be used by
       parties holding credit information to respond to requests, with all
       or part of the information as may be available in a data base. Upon
       receipt, the information can be used to support automated business
       decision processing and to update business data bases. BUSCRD may
       also be used to cancel previously transmitted information
       
       A single occurrence of BUSCRD may be used to request or to send
       information for one or more entities or to cancel one or more
       previous transmissions. The message beginning segment is used to
       indicate the specific message functionality.
       
       Cross referencing is permitted within the message to identify a
       related electronic exchange. There is typically no requirement to
       directly link external objects (e.g., associated data) to a business
       credit report. Stored data will normally be transmitted within the
       confines of the message structure.
       
       Changes to previously submitted data are considered as updates or
       replacements to the original data. The BUSCRD message structure does
       not provide for the identification of incremental changes. The
       receiving application should update the existing data with the
       revised or new data. If business practice requires retention of an
       auditable track of all data, then the receiving application should
       recognize the new data as a complete replacement, providing the
       necessary distinguishing criteria.
       
       While the BUSCRD message is independent of system applications, its
       structure derives from the manner in which credit information is
       developed and stored in data bases. Typically, credit information
       can be classified by category and type. BUSCRD structure is
       sufficiently flexible to accommodate industry and sectorial
       differences in data structures.
       
       The trigger segment of the group defining the hierarchy is used as
       the mechanism for accommodating differences in data content and data
       structure among users. Augmented functionality is attributed to this
       trigger segment permitting the identification of data dependencies
       and the content of hierarchically related segment groups. The
       continuation of parent and/or child relationships is permitted at
       all necessary levels as is the identification of the level to which
       the hierarchy applies. This permits the transmission of hierarchical
       information to as many differing levels as may be necessary to
       report credit information, the relationship of credit history data,
       and the relationships among business entities such as parent,
       subsidiaries affiliates and similar entities.
       
       Information conveyed within a BUSCRD message may be considered as
       business sensitive data. Notwithstanding, there are no special
       security requirements incorporated in the message structure.
       Security issues should be treated as matters to be resolved among
       trading partners and will likely involve varying solutions.
       
       BUSCRD may be used to provide information about a company, its
       branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, or parent company. Names,
       addresses, work experiences, business or professional titles of
       management within a company may be included. Other names (e.g.,
       previous) and length of time a business has been operational may be
       reported. History of a company may include its previous locations,
       original starting details, and legal changes.
       
       Operational data about a company may be included. This information
       may consist of detailed descriptions of activities. Such as buying
       and selling patterns. It may also include buildings or other
       facilities used, whether owned or rented, number of employees,
       and/or monetary or quantity amounts of products produced, sold or
       held in inventory.
       
       Financial information could be the largest part of a Business credit
       report message. This may include typical balance sheet information
       of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Outstanding debt such
       as loans or debentures may be reported as well as repayment history.
       Required governmental, financial statement information, its format
       periodicity and completeness may be sent. Financial institution
       account information may be stated with information pertaining to
       types of accounts and average balance in each account. A comparison
       to industry norms may be included.
       
       Payment information forms another large part of the BUSCRD message.
       This may include history of payments to suppliers and vendors.
       Breakdowns of payment amounts to specific payees. Payments made
       within contract terms, and past due or slow payments. A history of
       invoice payment terms to specific payees may be included along with
       discount percent and discount days due granted. A payment score
       indication promptness of payments over a period of time may be
       included.
       
       Public filings and legal actions may be reported although this
       varies among countries. Included may be any type of legal actions
       citing plaintiffs, defendants, attorneys, dates, status, legal
       damages and awards.
       
       An overall credit or risk assessment rating based upon the credit
       reporting agency's detailed analysis may be assigned. A detailed
       analysis of risk factors and credit or financial worthiness may be
       included.
