General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Medical
       prescription message (MEDPRE) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The MEDPRE message is sent from a prescriber (issuer) of
       prescriptions (healthcare professionals, i.e. physician, dentist, or
       veterinarian) to a dispensing agent (i.e. pharmacy) in order to
       allow the dispenser to deliver dispensed medicines(s) for the
       treatment of a subject of care (patient, patient group, animal or
       animal group).
       
       The MEDPRE message may also be sent via a relaying agent for storage
       until it is requested by a dispenser. Copies of the message may also
       be sent to parties entitled to receive a copy.
       
       The MEDPRE message can also be used as a request for a prescription
       from a dispensing agent to a prescriber.

1.2    Field of application

       The Medical prescription message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Medical prescription is an order to a dispenser to prepare
       prescribed medicines for a patient or animal and either to send them
       to a specific address or to await collection at the pharmacy.
       
       The following principles apply:
       
       - A Medical prescription message is issued to one subject of care:
       one patient, a group of patients, an animal, a group of animals, or
       for use by the issuer himself.
       
       - A Medical prescription message contains one prescription set which
       contains one or more prescription items, each of these for one
       medicinal product and/or appliance.
       
       - The prescribed medicinal product(s) can be identified by
       registered name, industry code, or a generic drug name.
       
       - The prescription may also be used for non-prescription medicinal
       products and/or appliances and other material from the pharmacy
       according to national regulations and local rules.
       
       - A prescription may contain extemporaneously dispensed medicines
       identified by a recipe.
       
       - The individual prescription item may contain information
       concerning repeat dispensing.
       
       - The individual prescription item as well as a complete
       prescription set may contain information concerning payment
       guarantor and payment details.
       
       - The dispensed medicine(s) can be delivered to the party at the
       pharmacy or alternatively sent to a specific address. All
       prescription items in a prescription set have the same delivery
       information.

2.     REFERENCES

       Section 2.

3.2    Message terms and definitions

       The word "prescription" is used for the prescribing of one single
       prescribed medicine. The word "prescription set" is used for one or
