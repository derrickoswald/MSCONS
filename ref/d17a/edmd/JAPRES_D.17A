0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job application
       result message (JAPRES) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying decisions of an employer related to job
       applications and interviews and employment or rejections and, when
       necessary, reasons for the decisions or rejections. The message is
       transmitted from an employer or employment agency to an employment
       agency.

1.2    Field of application

       The Job application result message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is to provide detailed information of
       results or decisions of an employer related to a job application or
       an interview. A Job Application Result Message may contain detailed
       information of the employment of an applicant, the rejection of an
       applicant by the employer or the rejection of the offered job by the
       applicant. In case of the rejection by the applicant, reasons of the
       rejection can be given. A Job Application Result Message is
       transmitted from an employer or employment agency to the employment
       agency. A Job Application Result Message may contain detailed
       information of more than one job applicant or interview.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd' or
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that
       there is a functional requirement for an alternative format.
       
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months,
       etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
