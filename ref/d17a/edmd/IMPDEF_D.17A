0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the EDI implementation
       guide definition message (IMPDEF) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The EDI implementation guideline definition message (IMPDEF) permits
       the exchange of implementation details of an EDI message, including
       its usage and its presentation.

1.2    Field of application

       The EDI implementation guide definition message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The IMPDEF message provides an EDI mechanism for describing the
       contents of a specific Message Implementation Guideline (MIG) or
       Implementation Convention (IC) for an EDI message that is capable of
       being specified in the Directory Definition message (DIRDEF). One
       occurrence of the message shall contain only one MIG. An IMPDEF
       message for the message being implemented may contain:
       
       a. the specification of the implementation usage
       b. additional implementation guidance
       c. presentation and processing guidance
       
       The IMPDEF message shall describe usage of all necessary components
       (segment groups, segments, composite data elements, simple data
       elements and code values) from an identified source message,
       together with additional components (non-coded data values or
       ranges), to effect an implementation of the target message. 
       
       The IMPDEF message may describe those components which are not used.
       By default, those components of the source message which are not
       referenced, are not used in the implementation.
       
       The IMPDEF message shall identify the source message upon which it
       is based. This identification may reference the source message
       contained either in a standard directory or in a separate DIRDEF
       message.
       
       The IMPDEF message shall contain a complete MIG or IC and it shall
       not be used for update or maintenance purposes.
       
       The hierarchical nature of both the source and target message
       structure must be preserved in the IMPDEF message. For example, this
       means that segment group information must be located immediately
       after the segment context of the trigger segment is established.
       Similarly, constituent element information must immediately follow
       the establishment of a segment or composite context, as must coded
       or non-coded values their element context.
       
       The main body of the MIG is carried by repeated instances of the DFN
       loop. This loop can be used to encapsulate blocks of components and
       place them in any given prevailing context. It can also be used to
       define aliases or constraint blocks. In ordinary use, the DFN
       segment acts as a device to allow the logic flow to cycle through
       the optional segment groups inside the DFN-triggered segment group
       in the correct order to follow the hierarchical message structure.
       The segment groups within the DFN-triggered segment group are
       ordered so as to minimise the number of repeats within ordinary use.
       
       The IMPDEF message maintains a context through the use of the
       segment groups within the DFN-triggered segment group. The DFN
       segment provides a means to redefine or re-establish the current
       context. The segment group that follows the DFN segment (and its
       associated FTX segment[s]) determines which context is being
       changed. For example, in normal message hierarchy sequence, codes
       are defined for elements within segments. To revert back to the
       segment context, a DFN segment would be followed by an ELU segment;
       similarly, to change the segment context, a DFN segment would be
       followed by an SGU segment. However, components such as repeats,
       references or relationships are considered to be applied in the
       context at which they are defined. Thus repeats, references,
       relationships or data representations may be applied to the whole
       message, individual segments, elements or composites.
       
       When the DFN is used to perform encapsulation, the current context
       is considered to be stacked upon entry, inherited within, and
       restored upon exit. However, any encapsulated block may establish
       its own context at any time, either retaining or discarding any or
       all of the inherited context. Upon exit, the previous context is re-
       established, but may be immediately modified, in whole or part, by
       the components that follow the closing DFN segment.
       
       The ordering of the components is governed by the source message
       hierarchy. Whilst the components at any particular level may be
       carried in any order, the message hierarchy must be maintained. This
       means that usage requirements of data elements within a segment must
       follow the usage requirements of that segment, but may themselves be
       presented in any order. Similarly, usage requirements of individual
       segments within a segment group must follow the trigger segment and
       the group definition and be presented together, but in any order.
       
       Where constraints are used, and a constraint is active either
       because the constraint expression at the start of the constraint is
       true or because the implicit context of the constraint definition is
       active, then the usage specifications inside the constraint block
       shall prevail against those which would apply were the constraint
       not active. For example, if a segment is implicitly 'Not Used' by
       not being mentioned in the main body of the MIG or IC, but is
       explicitly tagged as 'Required' within an active constraint, then
       the prevailing usage shall be 'Required'. Conversely, if a segment
       is explicitly used in the main body of the MIG or IC, and also
       explicitly tagged as 'Not Used' within an active constraint then the
       prevailing usage shall be 'Not Used'.
       
       The Interchange header shall specify character set level C.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

3.2    Message terms and definitions

       The following additional definitions are for constituent parts of a
       message whose implementation is being described within an IMPDEF
       message:
       
       Alias: this is used to describe a group of components collected
       together and named for frequent or repetitive use.
       
       Component: this is used in a generic sense to apply to any item
       which may be a part of, or referenced by a part of a MIG. Thus it
       may refer to a segment, a segment group, a simple or composite
       element, a code list or individual code or non-coded value. It may
       also refer to structures such as an alias or a constraint within a
       MIG.
       
       Constraint: this is used to describe a group of components with
       either an explicit or implicit constraint expression, which may be
       named for error reporting and context determination.
       
       Source Message: this is used to refer to the original message
       specification as published in the relevant standard by the
       responsible authority.
       
       Target Message: this is used to refer to the resultant message
       specification produced by applying the restrictions, clarifications
       and constraints contained within the MIG to the Source Message.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

00080   FTX, Free text
        A segment providing implementation guide notes which relate to the
        implementation as a whole. It may also carry various legal or
        contractual phrases which may apply to the ownership or copyright
        of the implementation guide, or contractual terms which will be
        incorporated by reference into any contract of which a data
        transmission using this implementation is a part.


00090   Segment group 1:  PNA-ADR-SG2
        A group of segments identifying the parties involved in the
        transaction with associated information. For publicly available
        implementation guides this includes details of the ownership and
        origination of the guide.

00100      PNA, Party identification
           A segment identifying the names of the parties involved in the
           transaction, e.g., originator, requester, author or secretariat.

00110      ADR, Address
           A segment identifying the address of the party.


00120      Segment group 2:  CTA-COM
           A group of segments identifying a person or a department and
           identifying communication type and number.

00130         CTA, Contact information
              A segment identifying a person or a department for the party
              to whom the communication should be directed.

00140         COM, Communication contact
              A segment identifying communication type and number of the
              person.


00150   Segment group 3:  DFN-FTX-SG4-SG5-SG6-SG7-SG8-SG9-SG10-SG11-SG12
        A group of segments to describe the usage of a segment, a segment
        group, a composite or an element, an alias, or a constraint in a
        MIG or IC. The iterations of this segment group form the bulk of
        the MIG or IC.
        
        The MIG or IC consists of a series of iterations of this segment
        group which describe the target message hierarchy. Within the
        hierarchy, additional occurrences of this segment group may specify
        the conditions or relationships between the components.
        
        Only the appropriate parts of this segment group should be used as
        necessary on any particular iteration. The other contained segment
        groups are ordered to minimise the number of iterations of this
        segment group. The 'Alias' and 'Constraint' instances of this
        segment group provide a mechanism for grouping or encapsulating
        blocks of components. An 'Alias' has no context, and therefore
        takes on the context of the point at which it is used. A
        'Constraint' inherits the context in which it is defined, but may
        redefine any part of its context by using the appropriate optional
        segment groups within the main segment loop. 
        
        As well as its defining function, each component may also be used
        in a constraining manner. For example, a repeating segment may not
        only define its components, but also the number of times it is
        allowed to repeat; then, within each instance, a different
        combination of element requirements may be expressed. This
        conditionality may be based on either ordering or content criteria.
        
        Once defined, an 'Alias' may be used throughout the MIG where
        required, by "using" the definition which is identified by its
        'name'. Similarly, in error reporting, an active constraint may be
        identified by its 'name'.

00160      DFN, Definition function
           A segment identifying the object of the definition, and
           containing an optional 'name' or identifier.

00170      FTX, Free text
           A segment providing implementation guide notes pertaining to the
           preceding definition, or to carry the text of a constraint
           expression.


00180      Segment group 4:  GRU-FTX
           A group of segments identifying a segment group and providing
           details about segment group usage. This segment group depends on
           a segment context having been established by an instance of a
           segment group describing segment usage.
           
           This segment group defines a segment group context for the
           target message, and will immediately follow the definition of
           the trigger segment context, preceding the constituent elements
           within the trigger segment.
           
           Several instances of the same segment group may be described,
           with the MEA segment group distinguishing which range or
           instance of the target message segment is being described.

00190         GRU, Segment group usage details
              A segment specifying the usage of a segment group in a
              definition. The segment may identify one or more instances of
              a target segment group.

00200         FTX, Free text
              A segment providing implementation guide notes or textual
              information related to the specific group in the underlying
              message.


00210      Segment group 5:  SGU-FTX
           A group of segments specifying segment usage within the
           definition. There will be at least one instance of this segment
           group for each segment described in the implementation guide.
           
           This segment group defines a segment context, and all the
           following components are deemed to be within the context of the
           segment whose usage is being defined until a subsequent segment
           context is defined.
           
           Several instances of the same segment may be described, with the
           MEA segment group distinguishing which range or instance of the
           target message segment is being described.

00220         SGU, Segment usage details
              A segment specifying the usage of a segment in a message type
              structure for this definition. As well as defining the
              specific usage of a particular target segment, this segment
              also provides the segment context for the following element
              usage details. The segment may identify one or more instances
              of usage for any particular segment in the target data
              message.

00230         FTX, Free text
              A segment providing implementation guide notes, or textual
              information relating to the specific segment in the
              underlying message.


00240      Segment group 6:  FNT-REL-GIR-FTX
           A group of segments specifying formalised relationships among
           the various components of this implementation at a particular
           context, such as additional rules concerning syntax and
           semantics which are specific to an implementation.
           
           The relationships may be both intra-component, such as between
           elements in a segment, or inter-component, such as between
           elements in different segments.
           
           Depending on the context in which this segment group is used, it
           may specify relationships between segments or segment groups in
           a message, between data elements in a segment, or between data
           elements in a composite.

00250         FNT, Footnote
              A segment specifying a footnote identification number that
              may place the relationship in the current context.

00260         REL, Relationship
              A segment specifying a relationship between the various
              components, typically data elements in a segment, in the
              current context.

00270         GIR, Related identification numbers
              A segment identifying the various components in a
              relationship, typically data elements in a segment, in the
              current context.

00280         FTX, Free text
              A segment carrying text notes to the preceding relationship.


00290      Segment group 7:  RFF-FTX
           A group of segments carrying references, or constraints whose
           default context applies to the containing segment. This segment
           group may be used to change the constraint mechanism at the
           current and deeper levels in the message hierarchy.
           Additionally, this segment group may be used to carry legal and
           contractual terms which relate, either by way of explanation or
           to be incorporated by reference, in the particular context at
           which the group appears.
           
           Depending on the context, the references may be applied to the
           target message as a whole, the current segment or element
           context, or the current code value context.

00300         RFF, Reference
              A segment identifying a reference document or a following
              constraint expression.

00310         FTX, Free text
              A segment carrying the text of a constraint expression or
              providing implementation guide notes pertaining to the
              preceding constraint.


00320      Segment group 8:  ELU-ELM-EDT-IMD-GEI-FTX
           A group of segments specifying implementation requirements for
           data elements in the current segment or composite context.
           Multiple instances of this segment group will typically be used
           to describe the usage of all the elements in any given segment
           or composite context. There will be at least one instance of
           this segment group for each element used, although a constraint
           structure may override or further define the specification in
           any particular context or sub-context. The MEA segment group may
           be used to provide repeat range or specific instance information
           for repeating data elements.
           
           This segment group defines an element or composite context which
           will remain in force until the next element or composite context
           is defined, or a new segment context is established.

00330         ELU, Data element usage details
              A segment identifying the usage of a simple or composite data

           coded data element. Multiple instances of this segment group may
           be used to provide a complete set of ranges or specific values,
           including preferences. It can be used for any other type of data
           element, such as strings, numerics, dates and times. It can also
           specify a default value and associated implementation notes for
           a specific element in a particular context. 
           
           A simple element or component element context must have been
           established before this segment group is used.

00430         ELV, Element value definition
              A segment identifying one or more components of an element
              value constraint series. It also may provide a default value
              for the current element context. This is expressed in a
              single text field so as to be used by or applicable to the
              broadest range of applications.
