0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Provisional
       booking message (IFTMBP) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Provisional Booking
       Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading
       partners in the transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of
       cargo and transport related information using Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI).
       
       This message is a single consignment based message, being aligned
       with other single consignment based messages such as the other two
       booking messages (IFTMBF and IFTMBC), the instruction messages
       (IFTMIN and IFTMCS) and the Arrival Notice Message (IFTMAN).
       The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes of
       transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any origin
       to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial
       practice.
       These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the transport of
       goods between all parties to the movement of the consignment
       (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the
       forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as providing the
       information necessary to perform that transport and delivery of the
       goods.
       
       They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport when
       the requirements are common even if functionally similar information
       is known by different names.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from a party requesting space and/or giving brief details
       of a planned consignment for forwarding and/or transport services to
       the party providing those services. In this message, the conditions
       under which the planned transport should take place can be given.

1.2    Field of application

       The Provisional booking message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A provisional booking should always be answered by a confirmation in
       any form by the service provider. Under normal circumstances a
       Provisional Booking Message is a first contact message between a
       shipper and a carrier, either followed by a Firm Booking Message
       and/or an Instruction Message.
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a
       single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in
       one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order
       transport for one or more goods items.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or issue
       instructions of transport to be arranged for several goods items by
       means of one or several of the following messages: IFTMBP, IFTMBF,
       IFTMBC, IFTMIN, IFTMCS, IFTMAN.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination
       haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or
       instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified
       with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a
       temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on
       another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to
       or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a
       container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on
       their own, are specified in the transport details group. Other load
       or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up
       to three levels.
