0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Registration of
       enterprise message (REGENT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message is designed to transmit legal, administrative and
       statutory information concerning the creation, change or cessation
       of a business activity within an enterprise. It can be exchanged
       between an enterprise and an authority responsible for registration
       or between any relevant body and its partners.

1.2    Field of application

       The Registration of enterprise message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message permits the transfer of information declared by an
       enterprise regardless of its legal status (self-employed person,
       company, corporation).
       
       The structure of the REGENT message is event oriented and may
       cover one or more events concerning the business activity of an
       enterprise.
       
       This structure is composed of three main levels:
       - the first one corresponds to the identification of the enterprise
       which is affected by the events,
       - the second one describes these events,
       - the third one provides detailed information related to an event.
       At that last level many different entities of the enterprise
       may be described, such as:
       - legal entity,
       - managers,
       - capital characteristics,
       - activity related information.
       
       The REGENT message may be used to transmit changes and updates.
