0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Consignment advice
       message (IFTMCA) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Consignment Advice Message
       to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading partners in the
       transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of cargo and transport
       related information using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
       This message is a single consignment based message, being aligned
       with other single consignment messages (IFTMBP, IFTMBF and IFTMBC),
       the Instruction Contract Status Message (IFTMCS) and the Arrival
       Notice Message (IFTMAN).
       The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes of
       transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any origin
       to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial
       practice.
       These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the transport of
       goods between all parties to the movement of the consignment
       (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the
       forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as providing the
       information necessary to perform that transport and delivery of
       goods.
       They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport when
       the requirements are common even if functionally similar information
       is known by different names.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message conveying prior notification of a consignment delivery,
       including non-hazardous and hazardous consignment details, for
       subsequent shipment and/or consolidation, or conveying a consignment
       advice for insurance from the party issuing a transport instruction
       or from the party issuing a transport contract to the insurer and/or
       the insurance intermediary. The message can also be used to confirm
       evidence of insurance, issued by the insurer to the shipper, bank or
       other third party (insurance certificate or policy).

1.2    Field of application

       The Consignment advice message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The consignment advice provides pre-notification of consignment
       delivery at a seaport, airport, railhead and
       consolidation/deconsolidation centres. The message may be used
       between consignors, consignor's agents and carriers to Receiving
       Authority and/or local agent.
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized. 
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a
       single container may contain one or more goods items.
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in
       one or more containers.
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order
       transport for one or more goods items.
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination
       haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or
       instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified
       with its own transport details group.
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a
       temperature control unit attached to a container.
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on
       another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to
       or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a
       container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on
       their own, are specified in the transport details group. Other load
       or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up
       to three levels.
       For insurance purposes the message can be used either by the shipper
       to inform the insurer and/or insurance intermediary about a planned
       transport, or by the shipper or carrier to inform the insurer and/or
       the insurance intermediary about a consignment under contract (bill
       of lading).
       When used to convey Insurance Certificate or Insurance Policy
       details the insurer or the underwriting agent of the insurer can
       confirm evidence of insurance for a consignment to the shipper, bank
       or third party.

       pallet).
       * TYPE OF EQUIPMENT: The type of material used, e.g. 40 feet
       container, four way pallet, mafi trailer.
