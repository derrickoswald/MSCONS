0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Product exchange
       reconciliation message (PRODEX) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the United Nations Standard
       Product Exchange Message to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners.

1.1    Functional definition

       The Product Exchange Message is a communication between two trading
       partners with agreements for the loan of products to each other, to
       provide information about movements of products from and to various
       locations on particular dates.
       
       The message gives additional information on the outstanding balances
       of each product between the trading partners.
       
       No financial value is attached to the products and settlement is
       usually carried out between like products.

1.2    Field of application

       The Product exchange reconciliation message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Each product exchange is covered by a bilateral contract and
       exchange accounts are balanced at agreed period ends.
       
       Each contract will define the units in which the product (or group
       of products) should be measured. This is known as The Unit of
       Account.
       
       A transaction forms the basis on which Product Exchanges are
       reconciled. A Transaction is defined as: a change of product title
       supported by the required data set for Delivery note/Ticket; or
       subsequently agreed Adjustments, Rebrands or Transfers.
       
       There may be many transactions within an accounting period.
       
       The product exchanged is identified by its product name, supply
       location, mode of transport, and date.

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Due to the high volume of data that will be usually transmitted in
       the Product Exchange Reconciliation message, it is highly
       recommended to use codes for products and locations. Conditional
       data that is not required in the message should not be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
