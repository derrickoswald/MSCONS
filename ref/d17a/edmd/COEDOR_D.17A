0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Transport
       equipment stock and profile report  message (COEDOR) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved
       in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to report transport equipment that is either in stock by
       the sending party (i.e. a terminal, depot or container freight
       station) or is part of the fleet of transport equipment being
       operated by a shipping line. It is also used to report the profiles
       of newly acquired transport equipment.
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers and other transport equipment by streamlining the
       information exchange. The business scenario for the container
       messages is clarified in a separate document, called 'Guide to the
       scenario of EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Transport equipment stock and profile report  message may be
       used for both national and international applications. It is based
       on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of transport equipment.
       
       Sending functions include:
       Container terminal (seaside), inland terminal (landside), container
       freight station, container depot, container repair facility,
       shipping line or shipping line agent.
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Shipping line or shipping line agent, tonnage centre, logistics
       centre, freight forwarder, container terminal, inland terminal,
       container freight station, container depot.
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT messages'
       (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following guidelines,
       rules and functionality apply to this Transport equipment stock and
       profile report message:
       
       *   The message contents of the Transport equipment stock report can
       be uniquely identified by a combination of the following data
       elements:
         -  message sender, coded (NAD)
         -  stock check date/time (DTM)
       
       The Transport equipment profile report can be identified by the
       following data element:
       - message sender, coded (NAD)
       
       A combination of the following data elements can be used to relate
       the business data contained in the Container acceptance order:
       - ordering customer coded (NAD) 
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD)
       
       *   One message may contain several containers identified by their
       prefix and serial number.
       
       *   For each container its stack position can be given, including
       the date and time of its checking by the stock reporter, and the
       date/time on which the container was delivered at the stock keeper's
       place.
       
       *   Also the transport status (= export, import, transhipment or
       continental), full/empty indication and the condition (damage) of
       the container can be specified.
       
       *   Depending on the transport status of the container additional
       information on the container can be given, such as carrier agent's
       reference, (seagoing) vessel, (sea) voyage number/indication and
       port of discharge.
       
       *   Goods item details cannot be completed.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
