0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Work grant
       decision message (WKGRDC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying details of decisions of the governmental agency
       to an employer relating to a work grant request or permit for one or
       more workers.

1.2    Field of application

       The Work grant decision message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is to provide detailed information and
       decisions of the governmental agency relating to a previous single
       work grant request message.
       
       A Work Grant Decision Message is transmitted from the governmental
       agency to an employer.
       
       A Work Grant Decision Message contains detailed information about
       the worker, the detail of the decision, the acceptance or the
       rejection and the reasons for the decision in case of a rejection. A
       Work Grant Decision Message may contain the full textual information
       of the decision.
       
       A Work Grant Decision Message also contains information of the
       profession and the place of work.
       
       A Work Grant Decision Message may also contain information and
       decisions relating to work grant requests for one or more workers.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd' or
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that
       there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods
       should be specified as whole numbers representing the required
       period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
