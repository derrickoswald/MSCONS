4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       -   Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used whenever possible.
       -   Data that is not necessary to meet the functional requirements
       of the message should not be included.
       -   Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
