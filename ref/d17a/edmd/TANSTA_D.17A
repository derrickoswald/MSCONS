0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Tank status report
       message (TANSTA) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from a vessel to the shipplanning department of a shipping
       line and vice versa (e.g. via satellite), giving details about the
       contents of ballast tanks, fuel tanks, water tanks and other figures
       necessary for the calculation of the stability of the vessel.

1.2    Field of application

       The Tank status report message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message serves to transmit information about all non-cargo
       deadweight items on board a vessel. This includes all ballast and
       service tanks, stores, crew and effects and other miscellaneous
       items including deadweight constants.
       
       The message can be used for transmission of either current or
       forecast status of tank and deadweight items. For example, the
       message may be used to transmit information relating to an actual
       departure condition from one port but can also be used to transmit
       data relating to a forecast arrival condition at another port.
       
       In general, the message will be generated on board by the ship's
       operator and transmitted to other parties interested in the vessel's
       stability and safety. This is normally the operations or tonnage
       centre but may also be a third party such as a terminal operator.
       
       In certain circumstances the message can also be transmitted to the
       vessel. In this case the contents of the message may be used to
       advise the ship's master of a desirable arrival condition.
