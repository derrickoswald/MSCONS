General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Data maintenance
       request definition message (DMRDEF) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This Data maintenance request definition message (DMRDEF) permits
       the transfer of a data maintenance request action among parties
       involved in the preparation, processing, assessment, resolution and
       directory production processes.

1.2    Field of application

       The Data maintenance request definition message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message permits the transmission of a Data Maintenance Request
       (DMR).
       
       The message may be exchanged at the regional or national level
       between the DMR submitter and the secretariat that acts as the entry
       point for DMR submissions to the submitter's technical assessment
       group. It may also be exchanged at an international level among the
       secretariats for the assessment function as well as those
       participating in the production of the directories.
       
       At the regional or national level the first DMRDEF sent for a given
       DMR will be from the submitter to the entry point secretariat
       utilizing the submitter's own reference number.
       
       On an international level the first DMRDEF sent for a given DMR will
       be from the entry point secretariat to the central secretariat
       utilizing the entry point secretariat's own unique reference (Log)
       number. All DMRDEF messages initiated after registration at the
       entry point secretariat will use the entry point secretariat Log
       numbers. All DMRDEF messages initiated after registration at the
       international level will use the central secretariat's Log number.
       The Data maintenance status report/query(DMSTAT) message will be
       used to notify all applicable parties of the latest log number
       assignments and other necessary status information.
       
       The DMRDEF message shall contain only a single Data maintenance
       request.
       
       For submissions of messages that allow the inclusion of substructure
       maintenance requirements in the same DMR, the segment identification
       segment group, the composite data element identification segment
       group, the simple data element segment group, and the code set
       identification segment group are to be used to provide the modified
       substructure relative to the message's boilerplate. A structure
       defined below the message level, as part of a Message submission,
       must include a change indicator in the associated attribute segment
       of the structure to indicate that the structure is being detailed as
       a proposed modification in association with the message.
       
       The reference segment shall identify all related parent and child
       DMRs one level above and one level below the current level.
       
       DMRs which change an existing entry must provide a complete
       replacement entry with the changed parts identified via the change
       indicators. All changes to message structure must also include all
       resultant changes to boilerplate text.
       
       Use of the default service characters is required and the
       Interchange header shall specify character set level C.
       
       Proper use of the DMRDEF message within supporting applications
       assumes the availability and use of the EDI standard in conjunction
       with originator data entry mechanisms in order to ensure the
       accurate association of data maintenance actions with the standard.
