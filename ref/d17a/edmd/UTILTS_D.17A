General Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Utilities time
       series message (UTILTS) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       

1.1    Functional definition

       The Utilities time series message is sent between responsible
       parties in a utilities infrastructure for the purpose of reporting
       time series and connected technical and/or administrative
       information.

1.2    Field of application

       The Utilities time series message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The Utilities time series message may contain time series for
       metered values, forecasts, estimates, prices, etc. Connected to each
       time series there may be technical and administrative information,
       such as characteristics of a meter, exchange rates, etc. Each time
       series will be identified by the companies and/or locations that are
       reported, the product and the validity time period. The message may
       be an initial message and does not require a response.
