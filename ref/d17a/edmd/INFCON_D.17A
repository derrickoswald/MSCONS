General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Infrastructure
       condition message (INFCON) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Infrastructure condition message is sent by a responsible party
       to other interested parties regarding the condition of a component
       in a commercial services or utilities infrastructure.

1.2    Field of application

       The Infrastructure condition message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       An Infrastructure condition message concerning an infrastructure
       component may be sent:
       - To notify scheduled downtime
       - To notify unscheduled downtime
       - To forecast availability
       - On the occurrence of a selected event
       
       The message may be an initial message and does not require a
       response.
       
       The message contains condition, availability and other management
       information in coded or free text format.
       
       This message is typically used in cases where a component in a
       network is taken down for repair or has broken down, for example in:
       - Power grids
       - Gas or oil supplies lines
       - Road traffic management
       - Air traffic management
       - Telephone networks
       - Value added networks (VAN)

00140      LOC, Place/location identification
           A segment to identify the location of the component being
           reported. It is recommended that, where possible, codes should
           be used to identify the component to facilitate automatic
           processing.

00150      DTM, Date/time/period
           A segment to specify dates associated with the downtime,
