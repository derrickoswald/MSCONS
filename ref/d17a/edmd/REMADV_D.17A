0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Remittance advice
       message (REMADV) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Remittance Advice is a communication between trading partners,
       e.g. seller, buyer, financial institutions, which provides a
       detailed accounting relative to a payment, or other form of
       financial settlement, for the provision of goods and/or services as
       detailed in the advice.

1.2    Field of application

       The Remittance advice message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Remittance Advice is a notice of a payment to be made.
       
       - A Remittance Advice may cover one or more commercial trade
       transactions (and related financial transactions), such as invoices,
       credit notes, debit notes, etc.
       
       - A Remittance Advice may include a cross reference to a Payment
       Order.
       
       - A single Remittance Advice may relate to both national and
       international settlements.
       
       - Each Remittance Advice shall be calculated in only one currency,
       even though the related transaction is denominated in different
       currencies.
       
       - Each Remittance Advice shall relate to only one settlement date.
       
       - Where remittance advice relates to a dispute, the message :
       
       . does not necessarily relate to one settlement date
       . is not necessarily a notice for a payment to be made
       
       - A Remittance Advice may be initiated by either party according to
       agreements.

       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
