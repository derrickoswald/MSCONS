General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the In transit report
       detail message (ITRRPT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying to a delivery party, the details of goods
       within grouped consignments despatched by the delivering party. This
       message is used in a multi-step transportation process involving
       only consignors, grouping centres and consignees.
       
       A grouping centre (consolidation point) is a logistic point where
       goods are moved from one means of transport to another, to optimize
       transport cost. This message is not to be used to identify
       additional services related to the despatched goods (warehousing,
       packaging, etc.) which may be provided by the third party at the
       same location along with the Grouping service.

1.2    Field of application

       The In transit report detail message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       An In Transit Report Detail message always relates to one or many
       Despatch Advice messages sent to the parties concerned. This message
       refers to the goods identified in the referenced Despatch Advice
       messages
       
       When the recipient of the message is a grouping centre the message
       allows the grouping centre to consolidate consignments received from
       one or more original consignors or other grouping centres and
       despatch them to another grouping centre or to the consignee.
       
       When the recipient of the message is the consignee, it allows the
       consignee to match this message with the corresponding Despatch
       Advice messages already received from the consignor(s). In case of
       differences, the message allows the consignee to identify variances
       caused by a split consignment or by missing goods.
       
       The Cargo/goods handling and movement message (HANMOV) has been
       designed to identify additional handling services related to the
       despatched goods, such as storage or (re-)packaging.
       
       An ITRRPT message specifies the details of despatched goods
       (possibly re-grouped), corresponding to one or more original
       despatch advices; the references to the consignment(s) by which they
       transported can be included (the seller's and buyer's perspective).
       The message does not necessarily provide full consignment details as
       required for transport purposes ( the carrier's perspective).
       
       The message refers to goods despatched on a single unit of transport
       (e.g. a single truck, a single railway wagon etc.).
       
       The sender of the message may be:
       
       . The consignor; in this case the message may refer to several
       buyers and consignees, but to only one seller.
       
       . A grouping centre; in this case the message may refer to several
       buyers, consignors, consignees and sellers.
       
       The recipient of the message may be:
       
       . A grouping centre; in this case the message may refer to several
       sellers, consignors, consignees and buyers.
       
       . The consignee; in this case the message may refer to several
       sellers, but only one buyer and one consignee.
       
       The following diagram illustrates the information flows.

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format.
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months,
       etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Care must be taken to avoid the conflicting use of qualifiers.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
