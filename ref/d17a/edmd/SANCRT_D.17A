0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the International
       movement of goods governmental regulatory message (SANCRT) to be
       used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The SANCRT message permits a commercial operator to apply to a
       national agency for the issue of a certificate, permit,
       authorization etc. in respect of products to be imported or
       exported. It further permits the issuing authority to transmit to
       the applicant and to the exporting or importing country's relevant
       national authority, (e.g. Customs, Agriculture etc.) the details of
       the certificate, permit or authorization in respect of those
       products thus facilitating the import/export clearance of the
       consignment whilst ensuring that all certificate, permit,
       authorization requirements are met.

1.2    Field of application

       The International movement of goods governmental regulatory message
       may be used for both national and international applications. It is
       based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may be used nationally and internationally by
       government authorities and commercial entities requesting, issuing
       or verifying permits, certificates, authorizations, licences, etc.
       in respect of imported and exported goods. Typically the message
       would be used:
       
       a) by an importer or exporter to request an issuing authority to
       issue a certificate, permit, etc.;
       
       b) by an issuing authority to inform the applicant that a
       certificate, permit, etc. has been issued;
       
       c) by an issuing authority to inform the national Customs authority
       of the details of the consignment that has been certified, licensed,
       etc.;
       
       d) by an issuing authority to inform an overseas authority (e.g.
       Food and Drug, Agriculture etc.) of the details of a consignment
       that has been certified, licensed, etc.
       
       The message is intended to cover a wide range of products requiring
       authorization, certification, etc. for a wide variety of reasons
       (e.g. sanitary/phytosanitary certification, certificate of origin,
       certificate of authenticity, import and export permits or licenses
       for various goods).
       
       - The message may be used for either imported or exported products.
       In both cases a single message is used for a product type consigned
       from a single consignor to a single consignee.
       
       - A certificate may cover several product items. A certificate
       should however be limited to product items of the same type or
       category.
       
       - All products covered by a certificate are transported together on
       the same transport vehicle or vehicle set at the same time.
       Transport can however occur over more than one stage.
       
       - The product may be in zero, one or more containers.
       
       - Inclusion of standard endorsements or generic textual declarations
       in the certificate is discouraged. It is recommended that these and
       other certification protocol requirements be accounted for outside
       the certificate in individual trading partner agreements.
