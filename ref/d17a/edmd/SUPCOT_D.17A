0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Superannuation
       contributions advice message (SUPCOT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Superannuation Contributions Advice is sent by a party to an
       organisation administering a superannuation scheme, to detail
       contribution payments made for members of the superannuation scheme.

1.2    Field of application

       The Superannuation contributions advice message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - a Superannuation Contributions Advice gives detailed information
       about a payment into a superannuation scheme for retirement benefit
       purposes.
       
       - the payment is generally on behalf of a number of members but
       could be for single member.
       
       - the payment may refer to multiple dates.
       
       - a Superannuation Contributions Advice is based on agreements
       between the parties.
       
       - contributions may be made by any party or on behalf of any party
       or parties; usually this means an employer and/or its employees.
