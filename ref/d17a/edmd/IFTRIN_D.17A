General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Forwarding and
       transport rate information message (IFTRIN) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The function of this message is to request transport rate
       information and to answer to such a request.

1.2    Field of application

       The Forwarding and transport rate information message may be used
       for both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may be used:
       
       a) to request transport rate information for a specific routing.
       Certain specific research criteria such as date/time of application,
       means of transport and type of rate desired may be specified to
       limit the volume of information requested.
       
       b) to answer to such a request, furnishing a list of rates selected
       in accordance with the selection criteria.
       
       c) to request transport additional precision concerning a specific
       rate.
       
       d) to answer to such a request, furnishing the additional
       information requested.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
