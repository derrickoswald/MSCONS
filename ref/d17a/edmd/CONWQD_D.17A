0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Work item quantity
       determination message (CONWQD) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       There are occasions during the construction process when it is
       required to substantiate the quantities associated with specific
       sections of work. This message will be needed by various parties
       involved in the project to determine these quantity details.

1.1    Functional definition

       Typically this message will be used between a contractor and the
       client's representative or other partners within the construction
       process, for justifying the work item quantities given in messages
       that describe the work items or their progress valuations.

1.2    Field of application

       The Work item quantity determination message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       There are several examples within the construction process where one
       party is required to justify to another party the quantities per
       work item he has already given in earlier messages.
       
       A project may be subdivided into individual groupings of work,
       referred to as items and it is against the quantities of these items
       that a justification has to be given.
       
       Within the Construction industry there are numerous rules which
       govern this part of the process. Although efforts have been made to
       keep the design of the message generic, other potential users of
       this message are cautioned about the specific and original role for
       which it has been designed.
       
       This is only one of a number of messages being designed for the
       construction industry. This particular message refers to already
       described items of work or their progress valuation in earlier sent
       construction messages.
       
       This message is for verifiable and provable quantities per work item
       which include individual calculations with sub- and intermediate
       totals. The message contains the quantities and how they are
       assessed for each of the work items. For every work item the
       quantity per unit must be determined (except those with a flat rate,
       which are paid according to payment schedules). The unit of quantity
       is defined by common technical rules. Rules describe the way in
       which quantities are calculated. These use standard formulae.
