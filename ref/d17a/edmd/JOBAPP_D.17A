0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job application
       proposal message (JOBAPP) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying detailed information of proposals for one or
       more job applicants from an employment agency to an employer. The
       detailed information is related to profession, occupation, age,
       education, experiences, salaries, other benefits, requested location
       of the job, work and contract conditions.

1.2    Field of application

       The Job application proposal message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is to provide information of proposals
       for one or more job applicants. A Job Application Proposal Message
       is transmitted from an employment agency to an employer or an
       employment agency. A Job Application Proposal Message may contain
       detailed information, in form of advertisements, of one or more
       applicants. A Job Application Proposal Message may be related to
       earlier offered jobs or vacancies by an employer.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd' or
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that
       there is a functional requirement for an alternative format.
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months,
       etc.).
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.

       Information to be provided in the Header section:
