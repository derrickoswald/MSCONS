0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       stuffing/stripping order message (COSTOR) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Order that specified goods/consignments are to be stuffed into
       (already or still to be delivered) or stripped from LCL-containers.
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified in a
       separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container stuffing/stripping order message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic center
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Container freight station
       
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Container
       stuffing/stripping order message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination
       of the following data elements:
       - carrier agent, coded (NAD)
       - carrier, coded (TDT)
       - stuffing/stripping order reference number (RFF)
       
       *   One shipping line, one seagoing vessel, one sea voyage number
       and one shipping agent can be specified on message top level.
       
       *   An indicator for the transport status (i.e., export, import,
       transhipment or continental) can be completed on container level
       (EQD-segment).
       
       *   One message may contain several containers identified by their
       prefix and number or several equipment guidelines for groups of
       (empty) containers.
       
       *   If the container prefix and number is unknown, a supplementary
       container reference number (e.g. Container sequence number) can be
       used to identify a container group in the message to be able to
       refer to this information of the container(s) in e.g. the Container
       stuffing/stripping report message (COSTCO).
       
       *   Guidelines can be specified in the message in order to load
       (empty) containers that cannot be identified by their full prefix
       and serial numbers.
       In case of a guideline a combination of size and type and/or a
       certain range of equipment serial numbers (container prefix and
       numbers) can be given for a group of one or several containers.
       
       *   Inland transport details can be specified for each individual
       container or can be specified on message top level (for all
       containers in the message); the two options must not be used
       simultaneously.
       
       *   An inland transport charges reference or a sea booking reference
       can be specified either on message top level (related to all
       containers in the message) or for each individual container; the two
       options must not be used simultaneously.
       
       *   For each container details can be specified such as container
       prefix and number, size and/or type, loading instructions, special
       instructions, and non-standard dimensions.
       
       *   In case of export the port of discharge and a port of
       transhipment can be specified for each individual container.
       
       *   An LCL (Less than Full Container Load) goods item may be
       detailed, such as number and type of packages, goods description,
       gross weight, dangerous goods information and special instructions.
       
       *   Goods item information can be related to the corresponding
       containers by linking the goods item group (GID) to the container
       details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP-segment.
       
       *   The ultimate date/time of stuffing/stripping can be given for
       each individual LCL-container.
       
       *   Each LCL-consignment can be identified by means of a booking
       reference and the original shipper, and may consist of several LCL
       goods items.
       
       * The address to which the empty container(s) are to be returned
       after stripping can be included, together with corresponding
       reference number(s) on message level.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
