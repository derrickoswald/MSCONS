0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Application error
       and acknowledgement message (APERAK) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The function of this message is: 
       a)  to inform a message issuer that his message has been received by
       the addressee's application and has been rejected due to errors
       encountered during its processing in the application.
       b)  to acknowledge to a message issuer the receipt of his message by
       the addressee's application.

1.2    Field of application

       The Application error and acknowledgement message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A message being first controlled at system level (CONTRL) to detect
       syntax errors and to acknowledge its receipt is then transmitted to
       the application process to be processed.
        
       If an error is detected at the application level, which prevents its
       complete processing, an APERAK message is sent to the original
       message issuer giving details of the error(s) encountered.
       If no error has been detected and when an acknowledgement is
       necessary (when no dedicated answer to the original message exists)
       an APERAK message is sent precising the reasons of acknowledgement.
       In case of application error, the APERAK message will need manual
       processing e.g. when the underlying reason is a programming error.
       
       In case of acknowledgement the APERAK message may be automatically
       or manually processed at recipient's discretion.
