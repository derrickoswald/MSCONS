0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Project tasks
       planning message (PROTAP) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Project Tasks Planning message is used in various industry
       sectors when there is a requirement for all parties involved to
       formally establish and exchange planning and scheduling information.
       This information describes the tasks and resources needed to
       complete a project or provide a service. This can include such
       details as what activities or tasks are involved, who is available
       to do the work, who is doing the work, what must be completed or
       delivered such as a document or goods, and when the work will be
       completed or when the item will be delivered. This document may be
       part of the contractual documents exchanged for the preparation,
       status, or completion of a project or service.

1.2    Field of application

       The Project tasks planning message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The industry sectors that typically exchange planning and scheduling
       information include construction, aerospace, aircraft, utility,
       defense, facility maintenance, automotive, and software development.
       Various government entities such as transportation, energy, space,
       and defense also exchange planning and scheduling information with
       their contractors related to construction, software development,
       research and development, and production. For departments or
       ministries of defense, this planning and scheduling information is
       typically part of the contractual requirements for weapon system
       acquisition and chemical or hazardous material disposal. 
       
       Although various regional and international differences do exist in
       the business terms used in a planning and scheduling environment,
       the underlying business requirements are similar. In many respects,
       the various commercial off the shelf application software used for
       planning and scheduling around the world have established a default
       set of common principles and data requirements. Where regional and
       international differences do exist in business terms, the design of
       the message is flexible enough to accommodate them.

1.3    Principles

       This message is designed to convey planning, scheduling, and
       resource information about a project and the business environment
       related to the project in a neutral data format. This information
       exchange can be bi-directional between the parties involved. Only
       data associated with one schedule or plan is exchanged per
       occurrence of this message. 
       
       This message is structured to support the exchange of the three main
       groups of independent yet interrelated information typical in a
       project management environment and commercial off the shelf
       application software. These main groups of information are
       represented as segment groups within this message and can be used
       independently or together as needed to fit the requirements of the
       project. The main groups of information are 1) resource
       availability; 2) calendar information; and 3) activity or task
       details with related resource, calendar, milestone, and constraint
       information. 
       
       The header section in this message includes the resource
       availability segment group. The detail section in this message
       includes the calendar information and activity or task details.
       While all three groups of information can be classified as detail
       data, the resource availability segment group was placed in the
       header section to prevent segment collision. In addition, the
       resource availability and calendar information is only exchanged
       infrequently; the core of the message is the activity or task
       segment group as this is the data that needs to be exchanged
       frequently to adequately manage a project. 
       
       This message can be used to exchange resource availability,
       calendar, task and related information between commercial off the
       shelf or company unique program management software applications.
       This exchange can be internal to company; for example, when one or
       more divisions within a company use different software applications
       or when the company wants to establish a common, standard data
       exchange format. This exchange can also be external to a company;
       for example, when data must be exchanged with customers, suppliers,
       or subcontractors regardless of the application software used by all
       parties. 
       
       Project planning and scheduling information can be highly
       proprietary to a company. The parties exchanging this data may elect
       to use various methods to ensure only the right people have access
       to the data. 
       
       1.3.1 Resource Availability Information
       
       The resource availability group of segments is designed to convey
       information about company-wide resources that may be employed to
       complete work. This includes all types of resources such as labor,
       material, manufacturing or testing facilities, or capital used
       through out the company for all their contracts. Information about
       availability (percent of total time available or available dates a
       resource can be devoted to a project or task), efficiency factors,
       unit rate, inflation percentage, quantity, and cost can be described
       as needed. Typically, this resource availability information is only
       conveyed early in the initial planning or proposal stage of a
       project or in the event the business base of the company has changed
       significantly during the execution of a project plan. Depending on
       the business environment or requirements of the trading partners,
       this availability information may not be exchanged at all. 
       
       1.3.2 Calendar Information
       
       The calendar group of segments is designed to convey information
       about the working calendars used to plan and schedule work. This
       includes information about non-working days, working hours, and
       holidays. There may be multiple working calendars if there are
       working shifts, different company divisions doing the work, or
       subcontractors doing the work. Typically, this calendar information
       is only conveyed early in the initial planning or proposal stage,
       when work is set to begin, or when there are substantial changes to
       the working environment. 
       
       1.3.3 Activity or Task Information
       
       The activity or task related group of segments is the main focus of
       this message. It is used to convey information about the tasks that
       must be done or milestone events that must occur to complete the
       project plan as well as progress against the original plan, or
       changes to the original plan. This can include information about
       what must be done, when it must be done, and related details about
       the activity or task. Quantity, monetary amounts, and percentages
       can also be associated with the task for planning or tracking
       progress. An activity or task may include a calendar reference. This
       reference, when used, can relate to the calendar information segment
       group details. 
       
       1.3.4 Activity or Task Related Information
       
       Within the group of segments used to describe an activity or task is
       subordinate group of segments that can be used to describe items
       that are related to an activity or task. This includes the resources
       assigned to a task (who is doing the work or what is needed to
       complete the work such as materials or facilities), a list of
       milestone events (a way to measure progress on a task), and
       relationships or constraints between activities. Quantity, monetary
       amounts, percentages, and rates can also be associated with these
       related items for planning or tracking progress. 
       
       When resources are assigned to an activity or task, these resources
       may relate to the resource availability segment group information if
       the option of building the resource availability data was used for
       the project. A project office can perform additional planning and
       scheduling functions with the combined information of available
       resources and resources assigned to a task to determine if there are
       enough resources available company-wide to complete a task. This may
       require the activity to be extended or require the company to hire
       or secure more resources to complete the work. In addition, a
       resource may include a calendar reference. This reference, when
       used, can relate to the calendar information segment group details. 
       
       1.3.5 Milestone Information
       
       Milestones can be handled in two ways in this message. They can be
       treated as an activity that is an event (i.e., the activity or task
       segment group in the detail section) or they can be treated as a
       subordinate event assigned to a main activity (i.e., the subordinate
       segment group to the line item in the detail section). 
       
       1.3.6 Adding, Changing, and Deleting Information
       
       Add, change, and delete notations are included for available
       resources, index structure details, tasks, milestones, and items
       related to a task such as milestones, resources, and constraint
       activities. This allows this message to be used in two ways. The
       first and most simple method is to send a PROTAP message that
       includes an entire set of data to completely replace or overwrite
       old data. The second and more complex method is to send only the
       tasks, resources, milestones, and so forth that have been added,
       changed, or deleted. The capabilities of the receiving application
       or receiving party's business environment will dictate how this
       capability is used. 
       
       1.3.7 Status Information
       
       This message is designed to convey initial planning and scheduling
       information, replanning information, and periodic project status
       information. Initial planning and scheduling information is used to
       establish the original baseline plan or schedule data between
       parties. This baseline provides the foundation for comparison for
       status information as the project progresses. In the event a project
       runs into difficulties, it may be necessary to replan the balance of
       the project, with new baseline plan or schedule data exchanged
       between parties. The periodic status information conveyed between
       parties can include remaining duration, percent complete, or actual
       start and complete dates. Milestones, quantities, percentages, and
       monetary amounts can be used to calculate the value of the work
       completed. For the exchange of periodic status information,
       typically only agreed to key data for the plan or schedule are
       exchanged. This is a smaller subset of the data required to
       establish a baseline or rebaseline plan.
       
       1.3.8 Other Functionality
       
       Other functionality available in this message include the following:
       
       Relationships to other projects can be described with notations on
       the type of relationship such as a parent, child, or other related
       schedule whether internal or external. 
       
       Relationships to other documents can be described with notations on
       the type of document, and where needed, information about the
       computing environment used to produce or process the information. 
       
       Related index structures can be described and defined for the
       project. This supports various reporting structures such as a Work
       Breakdown Structure or Organizational Breakdown Structure that
       relate to the project or specific tasks. The reporting structure can
       be up to six levels deep to accommodate very large, complex
       projects. 
       
       Notations about a work team, named responsible person, and product
       details related to an activity can also be conveyed.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

3.2    Message terms and definitions

       The terms "planning" and "scheduling" have different meanings. A
       project plan is a formal, approved document used to guide both
       project execution and project control. The primary uses of the
       project plan are to document planning assumptions and decisions,
       facilitate communication, and to document the approved scope, cost,
       and schedule baselines; these baselines serve as the foundation to
       measure progress and track changes. 
       
       A project schedule is an essential part of any project plan. A
       schedule provides the details about the activities that must be
       done, when they must be done, who is doing the work, and work
       progress measurement criteria. 
       
       The terms "task" and "activity" are used interchangeably to describe
       the work unit that must be completed to reach the end objective of
       the project.
