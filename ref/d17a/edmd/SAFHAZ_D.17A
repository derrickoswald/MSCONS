0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Safety and hazard
       data message (SAFHAZ) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Safety and hazard data message is to enable the communication of
       safety data and advice on relevant materials supplied to industrial
       customers so as to enable them to take measures to protect their
       employees and the environment from any potential harmful effects
       from these materials.

1.2    Field of application

       The Safety and hazard data message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The Safety data message has been designed to meet the requirements
       of both: the ISO recommendations and the EC Directive on Safety Data
       Requirements.
       
       The message incorporates all North American requirements as defined
       in the current ANSI transaction set.
       
       The message has been specifically designed to enable structured,
       semi-structured and unstructured data to be specified and
       transmitted.
       
       All future changes to the message must be checked against the
       various regional and national statutory requirements before the new
       version is published.
       
       A Safety data message relates to one dangerous or hazardous
       substance.
       
       A Safety data message is issued by the supplier of dangerous or
       hazardous substances.
       
       New or amended information about dangerous or hazardous substances
       must be quickly provided to every industrial recipient who has been
       supplied within a proscribed timescale.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd' or
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that
       there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods
       should be specified as whole numbers representing the required
       period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included. Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger
       segment of the group.
