General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Medical service
       request message (MEDREQ) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Medical Service Request message is sent from a service requester
       to the service provider to order investigations, to modify a
       previous order or ordered investigation or to cancel a previous
       order.

1.2    Field of application

       The Medical service request message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message fulfills the requirements of the European pre-standard
       concerning messages for exchange of laboratory information within
       clinical chemistry, clinical biochemistry, toxicology, clinical
       immunology, immunohaematology, haematology and clinical
       microbiology. The message may, however, also be used for other
       purposes as long as the user requirements are meet.
       
       The CEN prENV New Laboratory Service Order message and the CEN prENV
       Laboratory Service Order Cancellation message may be considered as
       special cases of the CEN prENV Laboratory Service Order Modification
       message. The Laboratory Service Order Modification message may
       contain a mixture of new, change, cancel and other service types for
       the order itself and for the various requested investigations
       whereas the New Laboratory Service Order message only contains the
       new service type for the order itself and the various requested
       investigations and the Laboratory Service Order Cancellation message
       only contains the cancel service type for a complete order.
       
       The overall structure of the message is:
       - One message may include one or more service orders. 
       - The service order is connected to one service provider, one
       service requester and optionally one or more parties to receive
       copies of the order and/or subsequent result message(s).
       - Every service order is related to one main subject of
       investigation (patient, animal or material), but may also include
       information about several related subjects of investigation.
       - Every service order may request services concerning one or more
       samples (from the same subject of investigation) or the subject of
       investigation itself.
       - Every sample may have one collection site.
       - A requested investigation may be connected to one or more samples
       or to the subject of investigation itself.
       
       With the exception of information in FTX segments, all information
       should primarily be expressed as codes.
