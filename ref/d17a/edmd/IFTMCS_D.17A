0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Instruction
       contract status message (IFTMCS) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Instruction Contract
       Status Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading
       partners in the transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of
       cargo and transport related information using Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI).
       
       This message is a single consignment based message, being aligned
       with other single consignment based messages such as the booking
       messages  (IFTMBP, IFTMBF and IFTMBC), the Instruction Message
       (IFTMIN) and the Arrival Notice Message (IFTMAN).
       The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes of
       transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any origin
       to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial
       practice.
       These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the transport of
       goods between all parties to the movement of the consignment
       (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the
       forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as providing the
       information necessary to perform that transport and delivery of the
       goods.
       
       They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport when
       the requirements are common even if functionally similar information
       is known by different names.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from the party providing the transport/forwarding services
       to the party that issued the instructions for those services stating
       the actual details, terms and conditions (charges when applicable)
       of the service and of the consignment involved. In addition it can
       be used for the exchange of contract information between carriers
       mutually.

1.2    Field of application

       The Instruction contract status message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The party providing the transport services will send an instruction
       contract status message, usually after receipt of the instruction
       message. The message can replace the actual contractual document
       such as for instance a Waybill, under those circumstances where
       there are no legal or other restrictions.
       
       The message might contain information concerning charges but should
       not be seen as a replacement for the invoice.
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a
       single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in
       one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination
       haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or
       instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified
       with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a
       temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on
       another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to
       or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a
       container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on
       their own, are specified in the transport details group. Other load
       or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up
       to three levels.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.

       A number of generic transport terms are used in this specification,
       to be described as:
       
       * MODE OF TRANSPORT: The method of transport used for the conveyance

       propulsion (e.g. sea container, trailer, unit load device, pallet).
       
       * TYPE OF EQUIPMENT: The type of material used, e.g. 40 feet
       container, four way pallet, mafi trailer.
