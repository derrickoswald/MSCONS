0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Dangerous goods
       notification message (IFTDGN) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The International Forwarding and Transport Dangerous Goods
       Notification message is a message from the party responsible to
       declare the dangerous goods (e.g. carrier's agent, freight
       forwarder) to the party acting on behalf of the local authority
       performing the checks on conformance with the legal requirements on
       the control of dangerous goods, normally Port Authority, conveying
       the information relating to one conveyance/voyage of a means of
       transport such as a vessel, train, truck or barge, on the dangerous
       goods being loaded, unloaded, and/or in transit.

1.2    Field of application

       The Dangerous goods notification message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message is meant to comply with the legal requirements of
       authorities concerning the notification/declaration of dangerous
       goods.
       
       1- One message relates to one conveyance/voyage of a means of
       transport.
       Remark: the message structure is aligned with the IFCSUM message
       (Forwarding and consolidation summary message).
       
       2- One message is to be suitable to declare both the dangerous goods
       to be discharged and loaded and the dangerous goods that remain on
       board (in transit). Only one handling operation per IFTDGN message
       can be reported, or a handling operation can be specified per
       consignment in IFTDGN.
       
       3- One message may relate to all dangerous goods information that
       the sender of the message is responsible for or to a certain part of
       that information; the information may be split in different
       messages, e.g. as it known at different times or the discharging
       information is sent separately from loading information or the
       information is split up in different messages for the different
       dangerous goods classes.
       
       4- One message is to be based on the local legal information
       requirements regarding the notification of dangerous goods to the
       (port) authority.
       N.B. This may mean that in a certain port the condition for a data
       element (or qualifier) that is conditional according to this
       specification, is that the data element (or qualifier) becomes
       mandatory for that port.
       
       5- A dangerous goods notification message may contain several
       consignments.
       
       6- A consignment may contain several goods items/dangerous goods
       classes.
       
       7- Each goods item can only contain one dangerous goods class. A
       goods item reflects the operational description of the goods.
       
       8- A dangerous goods class may be transported in one or more
       equipment, and a single equipment may contain one or more dangerous
       goods classes.
       
       9- The message has to cater for the provision of sending updates
       (change, deletion or cancellation).
       
       Remark: To cover all dangerous goods information relating to one
       conveyance/voyage of a means of transport might imply accumulation
       of several Dangerous Goods Notification messages from the same or
       several agents/forwarders.
       
       The Dangerous Goods Acknowledgement message is a message from the
       party acting on behalf of the local authority to the party
       responsible to declare the dangerous goods.
       
       Agent                                                Port
                                                         Authority
             -------  Dangerous Goods Notification    ------>
             <------  Dangerous Goods Acknowledgement -------
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
