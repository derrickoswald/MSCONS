0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Quality data
       message (QALITY) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to enable the transmission of the results of tests
       performed to satisfy a specified product or process requirement. The
       content includes, but is not limited to, test data and measurements,
       statistical information, and the testing methods employed.

1.2    Field of application

       The Quality data message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Quality Data Message detail line may refer to either goods items
       or services.
       
       - The values within a Quality Data Message may refer to: 
       
       . a product/service, 
       . a product via batch references,
       . process type information of a product.
       
       - A Quality Data Message may contain discrete or statistical values
       as well as product specification values.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.

00480      Segment group 12: CCI-PSD-SPS-DTM-FTX-SG13-SG14-SG16-SG18
           A group of segments to be used to define a class of properties,
           the individual properties within that class and the related data
           (e.g. discrete values, statistical information, test methods).
           When this segment group is used, the data is directly related to

              (6313) or Characteristic description code (7037) must be
              present.
              
              If Class type code (7059) AND Measured attribute code (6313)
              are present, then Characteristic description code (7037) is
              not allowed.
              
              If only Class type code is used within the CCI-segment, then
              the individual properties must be specified within the
              related STA/MEA-segments.
              
              The data element Characteristic description (7036) should
              only be used to enhance the meaning of the code value (e.g.
              if no specific code available and code value ZZ (mutually
              defined) is used then Description can be used to further
              describe the Product Characteristics.
              
              NB: The Class identification element in this segment is only
              used to specify the product characteristic class, e.g.
              Chemistry or Physical Dimensions.

              A segment to define the physical sample parameters associated
              with a test resulting in discrete measurements. If used in
              this position, the values only apply to data within the same
              analysis group.

00510         SPS, Sampling parameters for summary statistics
              A segment to define the sampling parameters associated with
              summary statistics reported. If used in this position, the
              values only apply to data within the same analysis group.

00520         DTM, Date/time/period
              A segment specifying the date, and when relevant, the time of
              an activity identified by the date/time qualifier, e.g.
              date/time, test performed.
