0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Enterprise
       accounting information message (INFENT) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message used to exchange enterprise related accounting information
       between enterprises, public or private bodies and whoever may use it
       for the purpose of accounting, auditing, cost accounting,
       consolidation, reporting, financial analysis, administrations, etc.

1.2    Field of application

       The Enterprise accounting information message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The economic partners of an enterprise require information, most of
       which is of a common nature. In order, therefore, to cope with this
       phenomenon, the enterprise - referred to as sender - may establish a
       data base - known as accounting information of enterprise -
       containing all the information of use to its partners, for various
       intervening bodies - referred to as recipients - who may be as
       follows: customers, suppliers, associated and other companies of the
       group, chartered accountants, auditors, legal, fiscal and financial
       advisers, lawyers, tax offices, the offices of court clerks, banks
       and financial houses, Public Authorities, etc.
       
       The preparation of the financial statements of an enterprise is a
       continuous chain which enables the trial balance and the financial
       statements to be obtained predominantly based on the accounting
       entries reflecting its activity and the chart of accounts.
       
       An enterprise accounting information is a piece of information or an
       event brought to the attention of an official, a private individual
       or a public body specifying a reference, a date, a time, a period, a
       free text, a name and address, a quantity, an accounting and
       administrative characteristic, a percentage, a legal status of
       organization or an amount in accordance with trading, financial,
       accounting, legal, social or fiscal relations, or in compliance with
       legislative provisions or regulations.
       
       An enterprise sends enterprise accounting information message in
       accordance to a predefined index. Each index value corresponds to an
       enterprise accounting information.
       
       The message INFENT contains information concerning enterprise
       information for a given period. The frequency of data collection
       ranges from daily to annually.
