General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Passenger list
       message (PAXLST) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This Passenger List Message (PAXLST) permits the transfer of
       passenger/crew data from a Customs, Immigration or other designated
       authority in the country of departure to the appropriate authorities
       in the country of arrival of the means of transport.
       
       Where national privacy legislation permits, and with the agreement
       of all parties involved, this message may also be exchanged between
       carriers and Customs, Immigration, Police or any designated
       authorities.
       
       This transfer of data may occur upon departure from the sending
       agency and prior to arrival of the vessel/ flight at the receiving
       agency. This is to permit the designated authority at the place of
       destination to screen this data and take timely decisions related to
       the clearance of passengers and crew.
       
       The transfer of data may also occur prior to departure, carriers may
       transmit passenger listings to customs and immigration for pre-
       arrival clearance.
       
       Endorsement of this message by the Customs Cooperation Council does
       not necessarily mean endorsement by national Immigration or Police
       authorities, nor does it place any obligations on parties to apply
       the message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Passenger list message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       This message may be applied for international passenger movement and
       is not dependent on the mode of transport.

1.3    Principles

       It is envisaged that the message will:
       
       (a) facilitate the clearance of low risk passengers/crew.
       
       (b) allow Customs, Immigration or police authorities to more
       effectively and efficiently concentrate resources on areas of
       highest risk.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
        - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       - Data that is not necessary to meet the functional requirements of
       the message should not be included.
       
       - Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
