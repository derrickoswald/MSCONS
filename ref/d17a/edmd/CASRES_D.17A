1.2    Field of application

       be used for both national and international applications. It is
       based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - This message represents the court or tribunal response for
       lodgement of data to commence or enforce civil proceeding.
       
       - The response may identify the parties involved in the dispute.
       
       - The response may provide information on the amount of money or any
       judgement that would be awarded to an individual party or
       collectively for the entire dispute.
       
       - The response may specify the terms of payment for the money
       awarded.
       
       - If the originating request contained erroneous information, the
