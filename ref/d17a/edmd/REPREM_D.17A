General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Reinsurance
       premium message (REPREM) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Reinsurance Premium Message (REPREM) allows to support the
       technical entries for any premium or brokerage adjustment amount.
       For this purpose, it enables to render all the relevant data (mainly
       amounts and the way they are built up) used in the actual
       calculation of the adjustment, as well as the other relevant
       elements used in the specific formula.

1.2    Field of application

       The Reinsurance premium message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A reinsurance technical account (catered for in the RETACC message)
       is only acceptable by the receiver if certain figures are supported
       by specific calculations, in which the sender explains how he
       arrived at these figures. This message caters for 3 of these
       specific calculations, i.e. premium adjustment (flat or
       retrospective - considering the past loss history for the contract),
       reinstatement premium (which is an additional premium to be paid by
       the reinsured in order to reinstate the cover granted by the
       reinsurer) and brokerage adjustment (triggered by a premium
       adjustment).
