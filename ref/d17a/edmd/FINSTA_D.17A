0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Financial
       statement of an account message (FINSTA) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message can be used to cater for various communication
       functions between financial institutions and their customers. The
       most frequent function is to provide a statement of booked items
       confirming entries on a customer's account. The message type may
       contain several accounts (quoted in the B-level).

1.2    Field of application

       The Financial statement of an account message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - Several accounts, value dates, entry dates and currencies may be
       specified.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles apply to the message and are
       intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the
       message: The Financial Statement of an Account message is structured
       in three levels: A,B and C. Level A starts with the UNH segment,
       level B starts with the LIN segment in Segment Group 4 and level C
       starts with the SEQ segment in Segment Group 6. 
        
       -   Level A contains general data related to the whole message and
       is contained in Segment Groups 1, 2, 3 and 7. 
       -   Level B contains the account related details such as balances,
       account number. Furthermore, this level describes the kind of
       statement. 
       -   Level C contains the single item as it was advised to the
       customer by a debit/credit advice. Furthermore, this level contains
       any level B of a multiple message such as PAYMUL, DEBMUL or CREMUL.
       In some special cases it is possible, that several B levels are
       contained in a message without any dependent C levels (balance
       confirmation for auditing purposes). 
        
       -   Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
