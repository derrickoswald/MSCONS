0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Inventory report
       message (INVRPT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the United Nations Standard
       Inventory Report Message to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       between trading partners.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying information relating to held inventories. The
       Inventory report message is intended to be used in either direction
       between trading partners.

1.2    Field of application

       The Inventory report message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The exchanged information will relate to inventories of raw
       materials, manufactured articles, or other stockable items, and can
       be exchanged between a manufacturer and distributor (wholesaler), or
       manufacturer and consignment holder, etc.
       
       The message includes functionality to differentiate classes of
       inventory, and to permit financial valuation of inventories
       facilitating price protection claims, auditing, statutory
       declarations, planning of production and deliveries, etc.
       
       The specified quantities relating to a product can indicate opening
       stock, closing stock, and goods movement (receipts or withdrawals)
       of held inventory, for a given time frame.
       
       The specified quantities can relate directly to a product or
       package, and may be sub-detailed within different groups or classes,
       e.g., batch, age, valuation, location, etc.
       
       For every specified quantity it is possible to indicate the relative
       package identifications of the physical units involved.

       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guide-lines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/ 'hhmm'
       unless all the parties involved in the transaction agree that there
       is a functional requirement for an alternative form. Periods should
       be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated to the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       the group.
