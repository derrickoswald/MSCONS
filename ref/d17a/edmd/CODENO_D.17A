General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Permit
       expiration/clearance ready notice message (CODENO) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved
       in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Notice specifying the cargo for which either the validity of the
       permits/Customs documents expires at short notice or for which
       regulatory Customs clearance has taken place.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified in a
       separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Permit expiration/clearance ready notice message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Container terminal, Inland terminal, Freight forwarder (including
       Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC))
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic Center, Freight forwarder
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Permit
       expiration/clearance ready notice message:
       
       *   In the case where the CODENO message is used as a Permit
       expiration notice the message contents can be uniquely identified by
       a combination of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer, coded (NAD)
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD)
       - container announcement reference number (being the acceptance
       order reference number) (RFF)
       In case the CODENO is used as a Customs clearance ready notice the
       message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination of the
       following message level data elements:
       - carrier agent, coded (shipping agent) (NAD)
       - carrier, coded (shipping line) (TDT)
       - carrier's agent reference number (RFF)
       
       *   In one message customs documents for several containers can be
       included.
       
       *   One shipping line, one seagoing vessel, one sea voyage number
       and one shipping agent can be specified on message top level.
       
       *   The document type, number, its date of issue and expiration can
       be given for each goods item which can be related to the
       corresponding containers by linking the goods item group (GID) to
       the container details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP segment.
       
       *   For logistic purposes the pick-up address of Customs documents
       can be specified.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
