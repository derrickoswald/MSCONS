0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Justified payment
       request message (JUPREQ) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message may be sent by an accounts payable service or
       equivalent to a payment service or equivalent to request the payment
       of a sum to one or several creditors. The message may provide all
       the details required for auditability purposes to justify the
       requested payment sum(s) in order to enable the payment to be made
       automatically after the necessary automatic validation (i.e., to
       ensure that all required information is present and is correct).

1.2    Field of application

       The Justified payment request message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Justified payment request message is sent by an accounts payable
       service or equivalent to a payment service or equivalent in order to
       request that payment be made to one or several creditors.
       
       The message may also include a reference to all the documents
       (electronic and paper) which justify the sum being requested to be
       paid thus providing the possibility to trace back to specific
       documents and consequently identify the originator (electronic
       messages being signed electronically) and the level of debt engaged.
