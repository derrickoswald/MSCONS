General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Forwarding and
       transport schedule and availability information message (IFTSAI) to
       be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading
       partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The function of this message is to request transport schedule or
       availability information and to answer to such a request.

1.2    Field of application

       The Forwarding and transport schedule and availability information
       message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may be used:
       
       a) to request operating means of transportation for a specific
       routing. Certain specific research criteria such as date/time of
       operation and type of transport desired may be precised to limit the
       volume of information requested.
       
       b) to answer to such a request furnishing a list of operating means
       of transport in accordance with the selection criteria. Such answer
       may comprise direct and/or combinations of means of transport.
       
       c) to request means of transport on which space is available for a
       specific routing. Certain specific research criteria like date/time
       of operation, type of transport and space desired may be precised to
       limit the volume of information requested.
       
       d) to answer to such request furnishing a list of available means of
       transport in accordance with the selection criteria. Such an answer
       may comprise direct and/or combinations of means of transport.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
