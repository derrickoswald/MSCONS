General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Delivery just in
       time message (DELJIT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message provides the ability for a customer to convey precise
       delivery sequence and Just In Time schedule requirements to a
       supplier, and is intended to supplement the Delivery Schedule
       Message (DELFOR).

1.2    Field of application

       The Delivery just in time message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The use of this message will facilitate the practice of Just In Time
       (JIT) delivery by providing the customer with a mechanism to issue
       precise shipping schedule requirements in terms of a 24 hour clock
       and on a more frequent basis than with the instance of a delivery
       schedule message, e.g. daily shipping schedules versus weekly
       planning schedules.

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
