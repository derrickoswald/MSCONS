1.2    Field of application

       The Request for quote message may be used for both national and

       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A potential buyer may solicit offers for one or more goods items
       or services.
       
       - A request for quote may refer to goods items or services related
       to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.

       additional information for customs and/or statistical purposes.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Data that is not necessary to meet the functional requirements of
       the message should not be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
