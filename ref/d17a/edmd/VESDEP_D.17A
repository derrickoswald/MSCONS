0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Vessel departure
       message (VESDEP) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from a stevedore to a liner agent or from a liner agent to
       a local authority (e.g. port authority) to inform the latter party
       of the departure of a vessel and giving information on the actual
       container or cargo operations.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified in a
       separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Vessel departure message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Vessel departure
       message:
       
       *   A message will contain information on only one means of
       transport/conveyance.
       
       *   Separate messages (Call information message and Vessel departure
       message) will be used for the means of transport in order to cater
       for opening and closing of the information exchange related to that
       means of transport. Updates for these messages may be sent.
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination
       of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer/principal
       - ordering customer agent
       - mode of transport
       - conveyance reference number/voyage number
       
       The ordering customer agent is to supplement the unique
       identification only when several agents are acting on behalf of the
       same shipping line for the same voyage number.
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination
       of the following message level data elements:
       -   voyage number or indication of sea transport (TDT or RFF)
       -   vessel radio call sign (TDT)
       -   shipping line (TDT)
       
       *   The message content includes the date and/or time on which all
       vessel operations have been completed.
       
       *   If containers have been loaded or discharged on or from the
       vessel, information on the actual handling of containers can be
       completed.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
