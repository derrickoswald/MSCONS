0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Bulk marine
       inspection summary report message (BMISRM) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from an inspection company to bulk cargo buyers and
       sellers, ship and barge owners, agents, or customs, identifying
       significant transport dates and times, as well as cargo quality and
       quantity information.

1.2    Field of application

       The Bulk marine inspection summary report message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message summarizes the flow of bulk marine cargo between seller
       and buyer as monitored by an inspection company, and is used for
       loss control. This message may also be used to replace the functions
       covered by time log information, certificate of analysis, and voyage
       analysis information as related to loss control and payment
       approval. This message can also be used to:
       - identify vessels, barges, tugs, ports and terminals, and
       associated voyage numbers
       - specify transportation details such as, docking dates and times,
       sea valve numbers, and vessel experience factors
       - specify bulk cargo by name, physical measurements and tests.
