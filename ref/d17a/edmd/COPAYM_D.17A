0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Contributions for
       payment (COPAYM) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from an enterprise to provide information that this
       enterprise has to declare for the payment of its social 
       contributions to the responsible authority.
       This message may be used to declare contributions based on the 
       salary amounts paid by the enterprise to its employees during a
       given period (the reference period of the declaration). It is also
       possible to declare contributions due only from the employer.

1.2    Field of application

       The Contributions for payment may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message allows an enterprise to declare its social
       contributions regarding all its employees or only a group of them.
       As a consequence, just one message only is sufficient to transmit
       the detailed declaration of several entities within an enterprise.
       Information declared by the enterprise may be associated with an
       administrative procedure identified by the document or message name.
       This message may be sent either directly by the enterprise or by a
       third party representing the enterprise.
