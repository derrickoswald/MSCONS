0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Intermediary
       system enablement or disablement message (ISENDS) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved
       in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Intermediary system enablement or disablement message is a
       multi-functional message designed specifically for insurance
       intermediary systems administration allowing trading agreements
       between insurance companies and their agents (intermediaries) for
       insurer products to be initially authorised and consequently
       controlled by the insurer. This encompasses the enabling (or
       disabling) of separately identifiable software driven business
       functions (new business, mid-term adjustment, renewal etc.) and thus
       administering the authorisation for point of sale usage for the
       individual components of the function. Associated ranges of numbers
       for insurer products can be initially allocated and maintained via
       the use of this message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Intermediary system enablement or disablement message may be
       used for both national and international applications. It is based
       on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message contains information relating to the agreement between
       one insurance intermediary (using software supplied by one software
       house) and one insurer. 
       
       The message can be used for the following scenarios: 
       
       - Request for initial authorisation from the intermediary -
       application for agency etc.
       
       - Authorisation from insurer - includes allocation of agency number,
       enablement of business functions etc.
       
       - Request for further number ranges from intermediary - covernotes
       for instance.
       
       - Confirmation that a request has been received (to compensate for
       processing delays) or that an authorisation has been applied.
       
       - New instruction - unsolicited and always from the insurer. Usually
       to change existing trading agreements, for instance annual update of
       policy ranges and disablement of business functions.

              use these attributes and any conditions associated when used
              from insurer to intermediary. The group should be used when
              the message is a request or an authorisation and only in a

              of business functionality, e.g. premium override.

              on the Intermediary's system. When used from insurer to
              intermediary this will be able to identify whether authority
              is granted, refused or revoked to produce the document at
              point of sale.
