0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Ledger message
       (LEDGER) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between
       trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The LEDGER message deals with the communication of accounting 
       ledgers between an organization and whoever may use them for  the
       purpose of accounting, auditing, cost accounting,  consolidation,
       financial analysis, etc.

1.2    Field of application

       The Ledger message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The accounting ledger may be prepared by an enterprise, a service
       bureau, a chartered accountant or an auditor - referred as a sender
       - for various involved parties - known as recipient - such as
       another enterprise, another service bureau, another chartered
       accountant or another auditor.
       The accounting ledger is reflecting the activity of the enterprise.
       It enables to establish the trial balance and consequently the
       financial statements.
       The term accounting ledger is taken to mean a selection of
       accounting entries or records describing the activity relating to
       ledger accounts for a specified period.
       The message LEDGER contains information concerning a ledger or
       a part of a ledger for a given period. The frequency of data
       collection ranges from daily to annually.
