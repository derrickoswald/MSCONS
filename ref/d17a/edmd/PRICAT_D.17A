0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Price/sales
       catalogue message (PRICAT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to enable the transmission of information regarding
       pricing and catalogue details for goods and services offered by a
       seller to a buyer.
       The message can also be sent by a buyer to a seller. This may be a
       response (acceptance or rejection) to a previously received
       price/sales catalogue message, or a notification of negotiated
       prices.

1.2    Field of application

       The Price/sales catalogue message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Price/Sales Catalogue Message Pricing-group or item may refer to
       either goods items or services.
       
       - The Price items are structured together according to industrial or
       commercial requirements.
       
       - The sales and delivery conditions within a Price/Sales Catalogue
       Message may refer to:
       
       . all product/service items of the Price/Sales Catalogue Message,
       . a group of product/service items,
       . a single product/service item in the message,
       . within a single product/service item to different price basis
       occurrences.
       
       - A Price/Sales Catalogue Message may contain product and price
       information, as well as sales conditions.
       
       - The Price Item Line may identify the component parts of the price
       item.
       
       When using the price/sales catalogue message to provide a response,
       the message sender may specify this information in one of two ways:
       
       - The total acceptance or rejection of a previous price/sales
       catalogue message;
       
       - The rejection of information either at a product group level or at
       an individual product level.

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the date/time/period format (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       the group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.

        A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
        related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at

        Examples of the use of this DTM segment are: Lead times that apply
        to the whole Price/Sales catalogue or expiration date/time of the
        Price/sales catalogue.
        
        The Date/time/period segment within other Segment groups should be
        used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically related

        manually.

           It is recommended that where possible only the coded form of the
           party ID should be specified, e.g. The sender and the receiver
           are known to each other, thus only the coded ID is required, but

           have to be clearly specified, preferably in structured format.
