0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Payment valuation
       message (CONPVA) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Typically this message will be used between a contractor and the
       client's representative, during the process of approving the value
       and payment for work completed for a given period of time.

1.2    Field of application

       The Payment valuation message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The following descriptions refer to the construction industry as an
       example, but do not exclude other business sectors' implementation.

1.3    Principles

       This message is to be used to support the business process of
       communicating the value of progress against groups of work items
       which make up a construction project.
       
       There are several examples within the construction process where one
       party is required to advise another party about the value of work
       performed during a specific time period or since the start of the
       project.
       
       A project may be subdivided into individual groupings of work,
       referred to as items and it is against these items that progress
       quantities are reported.
       
       Similar exchanges take place on the entire or part of the project
       and between other parties also involved in the construction of the
       project.
       
       Within the Construction industry there are numerous rules which
       govern this part of the process. Although, efforts have been made to
       keep the design of the message generic, other potential users of
       this message are cautioned about the specific and original role for
       which this message has been designed.
       
       This is only one of a number of messages being designed for the
       construction industry. This particular message refers to already
       established items of work, these items will have been defined at the
       start of the project. Work is well advanced for suitable EDI
       messages to address this part of the process.
       
       Allowance has been made within CONPVA message for "new" items of
       work. There are a number of reasons why additional items of work
       will occur once a project has started.
       
       Each work item may contain more than one quantity and this has been
       accommodated. An example of this would be the inclusion of both a
       cumulative and a "this period" quantity.
       
       In addition to conveying specific payment values this message is
       designed to record details of revisions and fluctuation to standard
       tables of rates and payment factors which are used in the
       calculation of the payment value.
       
       Confirmation of values processed for direct payment by the client
       are also catered for. These relate to individual entries within a
       CONDPV message.
