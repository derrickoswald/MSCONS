0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Statement of
       account message (STATAC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Statement of Account is a communication from a Seller or his agent
       to a Buyer or his agent, providing information about the status of
       an account at a specific point in time. It is used as an aid to
       reconciliation. At the same time it may be a reminder of payment
       due.

1.2    Field of application

       The Statement of account message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Statement of Account may refer to only one account, in one
       currency.
       
       - A statement of Account contains only outstanding debts and does
       not specify any debts which have been cleared since the previous
       Statement.
       
       - A Statement of Account may be initiated at any time by the Seller,
       depending upon agreement between the Buyer and the Seller.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
        All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when additional
       information that cannot be accommodated within the other segments is
       required.
