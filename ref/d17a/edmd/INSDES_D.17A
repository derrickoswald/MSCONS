0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Instruction to
       despatch message (INSDES) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from a party to another party who has control over ordered
       goods, providing instructions to put on hold or to despatch a
       consignment according to conditions specified in the message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Instruction to despatch message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Depending on circumstances the Instruction to Despatch message may
       be sent either from a buyer to a supplier (see point 1.3.1 below),
       or from a supplier or buyer to a third party service provider (see
       point 1.3.2 below).
       
       The Instruction to Despatch message may be used to;
       
       - request the delivery of goods being held by a third party (e.g.,
       warehouse, logistic service provider) on behalf of a buyer or
       supplier.
       - request the delivery of goods being held by the supplier until the
       buyer is in a position to receive them. For example, when ordering
       equipment for a new building the purchase order for the equipment
       will be issued before the start of physical building. As the
       building progresses equipment will be requested for delivery, for
       installation before the next phase of building starts, e.g., the
       heating system.
       - identify the exact delivery location;
       - identify the date on which delivery should take place;
       - etc.
       
       The Instruction to Despatch message must not be used to;
       
       - change information previously agreed on an order, e.g., price,
       ordered quantities, etc. The Purchase Order Change message must be
       used for this purpose.
       - order transport services for the despatch of the goods identified
       in the message. The message Transport Instruction must be used for
       this purpose.
       
       1.3.1 Buyer to Supplier
       
       The Instruction to Despatch message may be used by a buyer to inform
       his seller to release the despatch of goods previously ordered. In
       addition the message may be used to instruct the seller to hold the
       despatch of goods which have been previously reported as being ready
       for despatch.
       
       1.3.2 Buyer or Supplier to Third Party Service Provider.
       
       When the message is sent from a supplier or a buyer to a third party
       service provider it may be used to request the service provider to
       despatch specified goods, identify the delivery location, identify
       the date on which delivery should take place, and, or indicate that
       the despatch is subject to cash on delivery, etc.
       
       Because the third party service provider is outside the normal buyer
       to supplier order process the Instruction to Despatch message may be
       used by the supplier or buyer to inform the third party service
       provider of information stated in the order which is required for
       the effective despatch of the goods, e.g., terms of delivery,
       transport equipment required for the delivery, etc.
