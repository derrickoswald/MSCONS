General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Reinsurance
       bordereau message (REBORD) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A reinsurance bordereau message is made of individual policy data
       and their impact on a reinsurance contract. More specifically, the
       REBORD can be used to report how the reinsurance premiums or claims
       figures are built up, or to report individual cessions affecting a
       reinsurance contract.

1.2    Field of application

       The Reinsurance bordereau message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       REBORD supplies the basic information required to identify and
       allocate individual claims, outstanding losses and premium figures
       that appear amalgamated in the technical account (RETACC) or other
       messages (REPREM, RECLAM).
