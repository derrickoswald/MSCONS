General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Raw data reporting
       message (RDRMES) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Raw data reporting message (RDRMES) is sent in response to
       predefined and identified questions.
       Raw data are collected by numerous offices in the public and private
       sectors. Much of the data is predefined and repetitious. The data
       are often codified such that their description has been pre-set and
       meets the criteria of the collector.

1.2    Field of application

       The Raw data reporting message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The Raw data reporting message supports the transmission of multiple
       responses to one or more questionnaires, each uniquely identified.
       
       Concepts-definitions:
       
       Raw data: The respondent's answers to the collector's questionnaire.
       
       Respondent: The organization for which raw data are provided. Raw
       data may be sent by the responding organization or an agent acting
       on behalf of the responding organization.
       
       Collector: The organization to which raw data are provided. Raw data
       may be received by the collecting organization or an agent acting on
       behalf of the collecting agency.
       
       Questionnaire: A set of questions, with collector-assigned
       identifiers, addressed to a respondent.

       Message Composition-
       
       the message is comprised of two parts:
       
       - the first part describes administrative information concerning
       interchanging partners.
       
       - the second contains the predefined, identified questions and the
       raw data, along with associated information, including the
       organization responsible for maintaining identifiers, if required.
