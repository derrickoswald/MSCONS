General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Customs express
       consignment declaration message (CUSEXP) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message permits the transfer of express consignment data to a
       Customs Administration for the purpose of combining all three types
       of Customs reporting (conveyance report, cargo report and Customs
       Declaration) within a single message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Customs express consignment declaration message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       It is envisaged that the Customs Express Consignment Declaration
       Message (CUSEXP) will allow the reporting of individual or multiple
       consignments to a Customs Administration at the Master and House
       Transport Document level. The message may be used for either import
       or export purposes.
       
       The message is transmitted upon arrival of the goods, or where
       national legislation permits, prior to the arrival of the
       conveyance.
