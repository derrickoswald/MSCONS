0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Request for
       document message (REQDOC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to enable a party request the sending, or re-sending, of
       data, either as a document or message, or in some other agreed form.

1.2    Field of application

       The Request for document message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message is used to request a document to be sent, either
       electronically or otherwise. Its use should be limited to requesting
       documents, for which there is no other more specific message already
       provided (e.g. Request for Quotation).
       
       Parties can request documents on their own behalf, or on behalf of
       third parties.
       
       The message can be used to request individual documents by identity,
       or by specifying product and/or other related data to retrieve all
       relevant documents.
       
       Typical uses of the Request for Document Message are to request
       information from a data base (e.g. requesting a copy of a test
       certificate), requesting catalogue data, and requesting statements
       of account.

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.

00010   UNH, Message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Request for document message is REQDOC.

        Note: Request for document messages conforming to this document
        must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

        Data element  0065 REQDOC
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A
                      0051 UN

00020   BGM, Beginning of message
        A segment by which the sender must uniquely identify the request
        for document by means of its type and number.

00030   DOC, Document/message details
        A segment indicating the type of document that is required, how
        many copies, and in what form it is required, e.g. EDI, mail, etc.

00040   DTM, Date/time/period
        A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
        related to the whole message. The request preparation date must be
        specified using this segment.

00050   FTX, Free text
        A segment with free text information, in coded or clear form, used
        when additional information is needed but cannot be accommodated
        within other segments. In computer to computer exchanges such text
        will normally require the receiver to process this segment
        manually.


00060   Segment group 1:  RFF-DTM
        A group of segments for giving references and where necessary,
        their dates, relating to the whole message.

00070      RFF, Reference
           A segment identifying the reference by its number and where
           appropriate a line number within the document.

00080      DTM, Date/time/period
           A segment specifying the date/time related to the reference.

           A segment identifying names and addresses of the parties, in
           coded or clear form, and their functions relevant to the request
           for document message. Identification of the sender of the
           request and the recipient is mandatory for the request for
           document message. It is recommended that where possible only the
           coded form of the party ID should be specified e.g. the sender
           and receiver of the report are known to each other, thus only
           the coded ID is required, but when a new address might have to
           be clearly specified, e.g. where the document is to be sent to a
           third party, this should be done preferably in structured
           format.

00150   Segment group 4:  LIN-GEI-DTM-PIA-IMD-MEA-SG5-SG6
        A group of segments providing details of what information is
        required to be included in the document.
        There must be at least one occurrence of Segment group 4 within a
        request for document message.

           number and optionally identifying the product or service to be
