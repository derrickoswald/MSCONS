0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Purchase order
       change request message (ORDCHG) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       buyer's request to change a purchase order.

1.2    Field of application

       The Purchase order change request message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A buyer may request to change, or eventually cancel one or more
       goods items or services.
       
       A purchase order change request may refer to goods items or services
       related to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.
       
       A purchase order change request for cross-border transactions may
       contain additional information for customs and/or statistical
       purposes.
       
       A purchase order change request may contain details for transport
       and destination as well as delivery patterns.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       For guidance, the following principles serve to remove ambiguity in
       the application of an EDI Purchase Order Change.
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section


       Information to be provided in the Header section:

00010   UNH, Message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Purchase order change request message is
        ORDCHG.

        Note: Purchase order change request messages conforming to this
        document must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite
        S009:

        Data element  0065 ORDCHG
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A
                      0051 UN

00020   BGM, Beginning of message
        A segment by which the sender must uniquely identify the order
        change by means of its number and when necessary its function.
        
        If an Order is to be cancelled, use of Message Function Code (D/E:
        1225) '1' indicates that the transmitted message requests a
        complete cancellation of a referenced Purchase Order. All data is
        to be cancelled.
        
        If an Order is to be changed, use of Message function code '4'
        indicates that the transmitted message requests specified changes
        of the referred Purchase Order.
        
        If an Order is to be replaced, use of Message Function Code '5'
        indicates that the transmitted message effects a complete
        replacement of the referenced Purchase Order. All data are to be
        replaced in their entirety by that in the current message.
        
        If an Order response with changes is to be confirmed, use of
        Message Function Code '6' indicates the confirmation by the buyer
        of amendments proposed by the seller.
        
        If an Order is to be duplicated, use of Message Function Code '7'
        indicates that the transmitted message is an exact duplication of a
        previous Purchase Order Change Request.
        
        If an order is to be cancelled and to be re-issued, use of Message
        Function Code '17' indicates that the transmitted message effects a
        complete cancellation of the referenced Purchase Order, and that a
        Purchase Order will be issued.
        
        If only the heading section of an order is to be replaced, use of
        Message Function Code '20' indicates that the transmitted message
        effects changes in Heading Section data only. The complete Heading
        Section data is transmitted to replace all data previously sent.
        Detail and Summary Section data remain unchanged.
        
        If only item detail and summary is to be replaced, use of Message
        Function Code '21' indicates that the transmitted message effects
        changes in Detail Section data, and may affect Summary data.
        Heading Section data remains unchanged.
        
        To indicate the last and final release of an order, use Message
        Function Code '22'.
        
        If an order is to be placed on hold, use of Message Function Code
        '23' indicates that the processing against the referenced purchase
        order has been suspended until further release information. An
        order placed on hold is subsequently released by Message Function
        Code 'XX'.
        
        If an Order is to be accepted without amendment, use of Message
        Function Code '29' indicates that the buyer accepts the reference
        message without amendments.
        
        If an order is to be Changed in detail section, use of Message
        Function Code '36' indicates that the transmitted message requests
        specified changes in data in the Detail section. Changes are
        indicated at the line item level.

00030   DTM, Date/time/period
        A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
        related to the whole order or order change message. The segment
        must be specified at least once to identify the order change date.
        
        Examples of the use of this DTM segment are: Lead times that apply
        to the whole of the order and, if no schedule is to be specified,
        the delivery date.
        
        The Date/time/period segment within other Segment group should be
        used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically related
        to another specified data item. e.g. schedule dates are specified
        within Segment group 50.

00040   PAI, Payment instructions
        A segment changing conditions of payment, guarantee and method of
        payment for the whole order. An example of the use of this segment
        is to specify that a documentary credit will be used.

00050   ALI, Additional information

        A segment with free text information, in coded or clear form, used
        when additional information is needed but cannot be accommodated
        within other segments. In computer to computer exchanges such text
        will normally require the receiver to process this segment
        manually.

        line items.

           It is recommended that where possible only the coded form of the
