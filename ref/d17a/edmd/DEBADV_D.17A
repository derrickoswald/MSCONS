       transport.

1.     SCOPE

       A Debit Advice is sent by the Account Servicing Financial
       Institution to the Account Owner to inform the Account Owner that
       its account has been or will be debited for a specified amount on
       the date indicated, in settlement of the referenced business
       transaction(s).

1.2    Field of application

       The Debit advice message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Debit Advice may cover the financial settlement of one or more
       commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit notes, debit
       notes, etc. It is not intended for use in securities trading.
