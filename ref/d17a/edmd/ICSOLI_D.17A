1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Insurance claim solicitor's instruction message is exchanged
       between insurers and solicitors acting on behalf of the insurer

       claim details and instructions and the solicitor to report progress
       and resolution details.

1.2    Field of application

       The Insurance claim solicitor's instruction message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Each instance of the message contains information relating to one
       claim only.
       
       The message may be used to exchange information of a claim dispute
       irrespective of the type of resolution being applied e.g. court
       settlement, independent arbitration, negotiation etc.
       
       The message is used by insurers to provide policy and claim
       information to the solicitor and also to request a progress update.
       
       It is used by the solicitor to request information from an insurer
       as well as to provide progress and resolution details.
