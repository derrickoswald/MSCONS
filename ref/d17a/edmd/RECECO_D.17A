General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Credit risk cover
       message (RECECO) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Factoring companies provide their clients (the seller) protection
       against the risk of credit losses on sales to the buyers. Credit
       protection is provided on each approved customer (buyer) of the
       seller.
       
       The message will be used to apply for preliminary credit assessment
       (used during negotiation with prospective clients); apply for credit
       protection; reply to credit requests; revise amount and expiry date
       of credit protection and terms; cancel credit protection.
       
       The message will serve at the same time as the request for credit
       risk cover and as the answer (approval or rejection to that
       request).

1.2    Field of application

       The Credit risk cover message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       This message may be applied for both national and international
       settlements.

1.3    Principles

       The flow of communication is from Seller to Factor (request), and
       from Factor to Seller (answer). The Seller must provide information
       regarding the Buyers (name, address, etc.) and information regarding
       the expected amount of sales to be risk covered. The Factoring
       company will provide an answer, after due credit investigation.
       
       The credit cover may be a 'line cover' or an 'order cover'. A line
       cover relates to the sales of one seller to one buyer, up to the
       agreed limit. An order cover relates to a specific order (or
       shipment).
       
       - one credit cover may relate to one or more line covers; 
       - one credit cover may relate to one or more order covers; 
       - for each distinct period there is only one line cover; 
       - one credit cover must relate to one buyer; 
       - one credit cover must relate to one seller.
