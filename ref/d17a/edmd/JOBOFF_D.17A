0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job order message
       (JOBOFF) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between
       trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying details for one or more vacancies (occupation,
       salaries, experiences, work and contract conditions) for an employer
       to the employment agency.

1.2    Field of application

       The Job order message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is to provide detailed information of
       one or more jobs or vacancies offered by an employer to an
       employment agency or another employment agency. A Job Order Message
       is transmitted from an employer to an employment agency. A Job Order
       Message may contain detailed information about the requirements of
       an applicant for the job, e.g. age, sex, occupation or occupation
       type, location of the job, education, knowledge, experiences,
       salaries, work and contract conditions. A Job Order Message may also
       contain detailed information of the salary offered, a job
       application and/or arrangements for an interview.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message: 
       All specified dates or times should be in the format 'yymmdd' or
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that
       there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. 
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months,
       etc.) 
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible. Conditional data that is not required in
       the message should not be included. 
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.

        message type code for the Job order message is JOBOFF.
