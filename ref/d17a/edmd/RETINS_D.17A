0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Instruction for
       returns message (RETINS) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message by which a party informs another party whether and how
       goods shall be returned.

1.2    Field of application

       The Instruction for returns message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The sender of an instruction for returns message will normally have
       previously been informed by the recipient of the intention to return
       goods by means of the Announcement for Returns message.
       
       The instruction for returns message can be used to inform the
       receiving party on:
       
       - whether the goods shall be returned, repaired, destroyed, or
       disposed of;
       
       - which transport means and mode shall be used;
       
       - on or by which date the return shall take place;
       
       - which party is responsible for initialising transportation;
       
       - which party is responsible for the transportation costs;
       
       - any additional costs related to the return;
       
       - the carrier who shall carry out the transportation;
       
       - the address to which the returned goods should be sent;
       
       - any associated documents which will be raised in conjunction with
       the instruction for return, e.g. credit note.
       
       - fixed returns instructions for items which are returned on a
       scheduled basis, e.g. the collection of unsold newspapers will take
       place at a fixed time each week.
       
       The instruction for returns may also be used to specify additional
       information regarding the return of goods such as handling
       instructions or hazardous material information.
       
       The instruction for returns may be used to inform a party if the
       sender refuses, or does not require, return of the goods. It must in
       this case indicate what action the message recipient should carry
       out (e.g. disposal, destroy).

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd' /
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that
       there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods
       should be specified as whole numbers representing the required
       period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when additional
       information that cannot be accommodated within the other segments is
       required.
