0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Delivery schedule
       message (DELFOR) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       WARNING! This version of the DELFOR is not upward compatible with
       versions prior to D02A.
       
       DELFOR is a message which is sent from a party who is planning the
       use or consumption of products to a party who has to plan for the
       supply of the products. The message gives the requirements regarding
       details for short term delivery and/or medium to long scheduling for
       products. The scheduling can be used to authorize manufacturing and
       or the provision of materials.
       
       This is based on the terms and conditions defined in a purchase
       order or contract.
       
       The message may also be sent in response by a party which has
       received a DELFOR message to indicate to the party which has issued
       the message, the acceptance of, rejection of, or to propose
       amendments to the previous message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Delivery schedule message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       1.3.1 DELFOR used for scheduling and forecasting.
       
       The Delivery schedule message shall be used to:
       
       - specify firm delivery dates and the quantities scheduled (using
       segment SCC, data element Delivery plan commitment level code
       (4017)= "Firm".
       
       - specify forecasted production requirements (using SCC, data
       element Delivery plan commitment level code (4017)=either
       "commitment for manufacturing and material (2)" or "commitment for
       material (3)" or "planning/forecast (4)".
       
       - define the aspects that guarantee the synchronization between the
       supplying and receiving parties, thus allowing the supplier to plan
       for the resources necessary to fulfill customer requirements.
       
       The Delivery schedule message provides the option to use one of two
       scheduling methods.
       
       Method 1: delivery point driven
       This is when for a given delivery point a number of different
       products are to be delivered. This means that address information
       triggers product information. Usage of segment group NAD-LOC-FTX is
       consequently required for the specification of delivery points.
       
       Method 2: product driven
       This is when a given product is to be delivered to a number of
       different delivery points. This means that product information
       triggers address information.
       Consequently, segment group NAD-LOC-FTX is not to be used. Delivery
       point information shall be specified in segment group NAD-LOC-FTX
       included in the segment group LIN-PIA-IMD.
       
       An initiating Delivery schedule message is identified in the BGM
       with the "document name code (1001)" equal to "delivery schedule
       (241)" and "message function code (1225)" equal to "original (9)".
       
       A subsequent message may be used to replace the schedule completely
       (quantities and dates). This is identified in the BGM with the
       "message function code (1225)" equal to "replace (5)". The
       replacement of a schedule requires the new schedule to totally
       override the previous one.
       Alternatively the message may be used to partially alter the
       schedule. This is identified in the BGM with the "message function
       code (1225)" equal to "change (4)". Such alteration to the schedule
       shall adhere to the following recommendations:
       
       1.    All the date information in the QTY-DTM segment group shall be
       systematically used to identify the group to be changed.
       
       2.    How the information is to be changed:
       
       2.a. To change a quantity - where the date information matches the
       current quantity is replaced with the new quantity.
       
       2.b. To change a date - the current quantity has to be changed to
       zero and the new date information has to be given with the quantity
       from the former schedule.
       
       2.c. To change a date and quantity - the current quantity has to be
       changed to zero and the new date information has to be given with
       appropriate new quantity.
       
       2.d. To delete quantities and dates - the current quantity has to be
       changed to zero.
       
       2.e. To add quantities and dates - the new date information has to
       be given with the appropriate new quantity.
       
       3.    Unchanged dates and quantities - unchanged dates and
       quantities from the former schedule need to be resent.
       
       4.    Delivered quantities - delivered quantities are automatically
       eliminated from the schedule.
       
       The association to the previous Delivery schedule message is given
       by referencing the appropriate document/message number.
       
       1.3.2 DELFOR used for response purposes.
       
       The indication of a DELFOR message for response purposes is achieved
       through the use of 'Delivery Schedule Response' code value in data
       element 1001 of the BGM segment.
       
       When used as a response to a previous DELFOR message the message may
       be used to indicate one of the following conditions using code
       values in data element 1225 of the BGM segment:
       
       - Total acceptance;
       - Total rejection;
       - Not processed;
       - Proposal for change.
       
       Total acceptance of a previous DELFOR message may be indicated using
       code value '29, Accepted without amendment', in data element 1225 of
       the BGM segment. Where a previous DELFOR message is being totally
       accepted then only the EDIFACT mandatory segments, and those agreed
       by the parties exchanging the message which enable the
       identification of the previous message, need be re-sent.
       
       Total rejection of a previous DELFOR message may be indicated using
       code value '27, Not accepted', in data element 1225 of the BGM
       segment. Where a previous DELFOR message is being totally rejected
       then only the EDIFACT mandatory segments, and those agreed by the
       parties exchanging the message which enable the identification of
       the previous message, need be re-sent. If required the reason for
       rejection may be indicated in the FTX segment at header level using
       either a bi-laterally agreed reason code, or a free text reason.
       
       Should a DELFOR message have been received but not yet processed
       through the relevant internal application(s), a response may be
       issued indicating this fact using code value '12, Not processed', in
       data element 1225 of the BGM segment.
       Where this code value is being used then only the EDIFACT mandatory
       segments, and those agreed by the parties exchanging the message
       which enable the identification of the previous message, need be re-
       sent.
       
       When the party responding to a previous DELFOR message wishes to
       propose changes to some of the information contained in the previous
       message, then the code value '4, Change' should be used in data
       element 1225 of the BGM segment.
       
       If no information at the detail level of the message changes then
       only the EDIFACT mandatory segments, those agreed by the parties
       exchanging the message which enable the identification of the
       previous message, and the segments containing the data proposed for
       change need be re-sent.
       
       When changes are proposed to data contained at the detail level of
       the message then the following recommendations should be applied:
       
       1. All the date information in the QTY-DTM segment group shall be
       systematically used to identify the group to be changed.
       
       2. How the information is to be changed:
       
       2.a. To change a quantity - where the date information matches the
       current quantity is replaced with the new quantity.
       
       2.b. To change a date - the current quantity has to be changed to
       zero and the new date information has to be given with the quantity
       from the former schedule.
       
       2.c. To change a date and quantity - the current quantity has to be
       changed to zero and the new date information has to be given with
       appropriate new quantity.
       
       2.d. To delete quantities and dates - the current quantity has to be
       changed to zero.
       
       2.e. To add quantities and dates - the new date information has to
       be given with the appropriate new quantity.
       
       3. Unchanged dates and quantities - unchanged dates and quantities
       from the former schedule need to be resent.
       
       4. Delivered quantities - delivered quantities are automatically
       eliminated from the schedule.

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format.
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months,
       etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
