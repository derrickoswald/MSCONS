General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Reinsured objects
       list message (RELIST) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The RELIST provides partners involved in the placing of a
       reinsurance contract or endorsement structured details on individual
       items to be reinsured (partly for facultative risks); this generic
       item list can give details on any type of item, ranging from
       individual vessels, buildings, industrial sites, aircraft to
       exhibitions, fleets and groups of buildings or employees to name a
       few.

1.2    Field of application

       The Reinsured objects list message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       As RELIST message is a supporting message to the RECORD message it
       has therefore the same main structure (header, contract
       identification, subdivisions). Per subdivision, a set of generic and
       specific segments have been grouped to report any relevant and
       structural information relating to individual risks, such as type of
       aircraft or vessel, category, year, built, relevant measurements,
       etc.
       
       RELIST is one of a complimentary pair of messages for the placing of
       reinsurance business. The core business data for the contract is
       carried in the message RECORD whilst RELIST carries details of all
       the items covered under the terms of the contract.
