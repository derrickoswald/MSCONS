0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Payroll deductions
       advice message (PAYDUC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Payroll Deductions Advice is sent by a party (usually an
       employer or its representative) to a service providing organisation,
       to detail payments by payroll deductions, on behalf of employees,
       made to the service providing organisation.

1.2    Field of application

       The Payroll deductions advice message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       This message may be applied for both national and international
       payment advices where payment is through payroll deductions.

1.3    Principles

       - a Payroll Deductions Advice gives detailed information about a
       payment.
       
       - the payment is on behalf of one or more employees.
       
       - the payment may be for multiple services.
       
       - the payment may refer to multiple dates.
       
       - commission amounts may be deducted from gross payments.
       
       - a Payroll Deductions Advice is based on agreements between the
       parties.
       
       - the message allows for the transmission in the details section of
       either complete information of individual employee payments, or only
       the information regarding changes from nominated regular payments.
