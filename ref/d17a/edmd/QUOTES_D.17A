0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Quote message
       (QUOTES) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between
       trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message which provides potential sellers with the ability to
       provide price, delivery schedule, and other conditions for potential
       sales of goods or services.

1.2    Field of application

       The Quote message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A potential seller may offer one or more goods items or services.
       
       - A quotation may refer to goods items or services related to one or
       more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.
       
       - A quotation for cross border transactions may contain additional
       information for customs and/or statistical purposes.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Data that is not necessary to meet the functional requirements of
       the message should not be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
