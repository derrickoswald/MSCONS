General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       announcement message (COPARN) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The message contains an order to release, to make available, to
       accept or to call down containers or to announce the impending
       arrival of containers.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified in a
       separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages'.
       
       The order may pertain to cargo related containers (full container
       load and less than container load), the arrangement of empty
       containers prior to loading and after stripping, as well as the
       arrangements for leasing the empty containers (on-hire and off-hire
       of containers).

1.2    Field of application

       The Container announcement message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Shipper, Freight forwarder, Shipping agent, Container freight
       station, Consignee
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Freight forwarder, Shipping agent, Container terminal, Inland
       terminal, Container depot, Container freight station, Container
       lessor
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Container
       announcement message:
       
       *   The message contents can normally be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer, coded (NAD)
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD)
       - container announcement reference number (being the container
       release order reference, acceptance order reference, disposition
       order reference) (RFF)
       - related container announcement reference (reference to container
       disposition order) (RFF)
       
       In case the COPARN is used as an empty container notice the
       identification is normally achieved by:
       - carrier agent, coded (shipping agent) (EQD/NAD)
       - carrier, coded (shipping line) (TDT)
       - carrier agent's reference number (EQD/RFF)
       
       In case the COPARN is used as an on-hire request or order the
       identification is normally achieved by:
       - message sender (NAD)
       - lessee's reference (RFF)
       - indication on-hire request or order (BGM)
       
       In case the Container announcement message is used as an off-hire
       request or notice the identification is normally achieved by:
       - message sender (NAD)
       - return reference (RFF)
       - indication off-hire request or notice (BGM)
       
       The ordering customer agent, coded is needed to supplement the
       unique identification only in the next situation: the agent acts on
       behalf of several ordering customers issuing the same range of
       reference numbers for each customer.
       E.g. the ship's agent acts on behalf of several shipping lines
       issuing for each shipping line the same range of numbers.
       
       *   One shipping line, one seagoing vessel, one sea voyage number
       and one shipping agent can be specified on message top level.
       
       *   An indicator for the transport status (i.e., export, import,
       transhipment or continental) can be completed on container level
       (EQD-segment).
       
       *   One message may contain several containers identified by their
       prefix and number or several equipment guidelines for groups of
       (empty) containers.
       
       *   If the container prefix and number is unknown (in the Empty
       container disposition order or Container release order), a
       supplementary container reference number (Container sequence number)
       is used to identify a container group in the message to be able to
       refer to this information of the container(s) in e.g. the Container
       release order or the Container gate-in/gate-out message.
       
       *   In case of an Empty container disposition order several
       equipment guidelines can be specified in the message in order to
       load (empty) containers that cannot be identified by their full
       prefix and serial numbers.
       In case of a guideline a combination of size and type and/or a
       certain range of equipment serial numbers (container prefix and
       numbers) can  be given for a group of one or several containers.
       
       *   Inland transport details can be specified for each individual
       container or can be specified on message level (for all containers
       in the message); the two options must not be used simultaneously.
       
       *   An inland transport charges reference or a sea booking reference
       can be specified either on message level (related to all containers
       in the message) or for each individual container; the two options
       must not be used simultaneously.
       
       *   In case of an Empty container disposition order or a Call down
       order the place of positioning, related reference and date/time of
       positioning of the containers can be specified either on message
       level (related to all goods items in the message) or for each
       individual goods item (as the place where the goods item is to be
       stuffed or stripped); the two options must not be used
       simultaneously.
       In the latter case up to 10 places of positioning for each goods
       item to be stripped from or stuffed in the container(s) can be
       included in the message.
       
       *   In case of an Acceptance order the date and time of positioning
       of the containers at the place of positioning can be specified for
       each individual container.
       
       *   The final place of positioning can be included in case of
       routing via an inland terminal or several container freight stations
       (for stacking purposes).
       
       *   For each container up to 3 communication addresses can be
       specified to which a copy of the Container gate-in/gate-out report
       message is to be sent.
       
       *   For each container details can be specified such as container
       prefix and number, size/type, loading instructions, special
       instructions, seals, temperature, dangerous goods and off-dimensions
       details.
       
       *   In case of export the port of discharge and a port of
       transhipment can be specified for each individual container.
       
       *   A goods item may be detailed, such as number and type of
       packages, goods description, gross weight, dangerous goods
       information and special instruction.
       
       *   Goods item information can be related to the corresponding
       containers by linking the goods item group (GID) to the container
       details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP-segment.
       
       *   In case of export for each goods item up to 9 declarant's
       reference numbers can be given; in case of goods declaration
       (Customs) at the place of stuffing also 9 accompanying (Customs)
       documents can be given.
       
       * The return address (in case of an off-hire notice) can be given on
       message level or on container level, but not simultaneously. The
       region for the empty equipment return (in the request) can be given
       on message level. The reference at the return address or region of
       return can be given at the same level.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
