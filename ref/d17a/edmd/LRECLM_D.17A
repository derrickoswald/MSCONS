0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Life reinsurance
       claims message (LRECLM) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The LRECLM message is used by companies to exchange information
       regarding a claim or claims on a policy or policies which have been
       reinsured. The message will be used for both ceded and assumed
       reinsurance.
       
       The trading partners utilizing the Life reinsurance claims message
       will be direct companies, reinsurance companies, reinsurance
       intermediaries and retrocessionaires. The message will be used to
       transmit data required by ceding and assuming companies to
       communicate information for the orderly settlement
       of claims. It also facilitates the reconciliation of the reinsurance
       records in order to maintain the integrity of the data between the
       trading partners.

1.2    Field of application

       The Life reinsurance claims message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - The Life reinsurance claims message contains information about
       reinsured individual life insurance policies, reinsured disability
       insurance policies and reinsured annuity contracts administered
       under the terms and conditions of a reinsurance treaty.
       
       - This message contains specific reinsurance information about the
       base policy, the person on claim and the reinsured coverages
       associated with the claim.
       
       - The message is used to confirm the details of a claim and the
       person on claim under a specific reinsurance treaty and to
       communicate information regarding the status of the claim and the
       settlement of the claim.
       
       The following guidelines apply to the whole message and are intended
       to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:
       
       - All specified dates should include the century unless all parties
       involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional
       requirement for an alternative format.
       
       - Where a choice of code or text is given, only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
