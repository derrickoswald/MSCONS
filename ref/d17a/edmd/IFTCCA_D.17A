0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Forwarding and
       transport shipment charge calculation message (IFTCCA) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved
       in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The function of this message is to request the calculation of the
       transport charges of a specific shipment and to answer to such a
       request.

1.2    Field of application

       The Forwarding and transport shipment charge calculation message may
       be used for both national and international applications. It is
       based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may be used:
       
       a) to request the charge calculation of a specific shipment at a
       specific date. Certain specific criteria such as type of rate
       desired, number of packages/units, weights or volumes and dimensions
       can be provided to facilitate such calculation.
       
       b) to answer to such a request furnishing the transport charges
       calculated in accordance with the calculation criteria provided.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
