0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Multiple payment
       order message (PAYMUL) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Multiple Payment order is sent by the Ordering Customer (or Payor
       or Agent on behalf of the Ordering Customer) to the Ordered Bank, to
       instruct the Ordered Bank to debit an account it services for the
       Ordering Customer, and to arrange for the payment of specified
       amounts to several Beneficiaries (or Payees) in settlement of the
       referenced business transaction(s).
       
       Throughout this document, the term 'Ordering Customer' refers to
       either an Ordering Customer, or a Payor or Agent acting (sending) on
       behalf of the Ordering Customer; likewise the term 'Beneficiary'
       refers to either a Beneficiary, or a Payee or Agent acting on behalf
       of the Beneficiary.

1.2    Field of application

       The Multiple payment order message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       This message may be applied for both national and international
       settlements.

1.3    Principles

       - A Multiple Payment Order may cover the financial settlement of one
       or more commercial trade transactions such as invoices credit notes,
       debit notes etc. It is not intended for use in securities trading.
       
       - Charges may be borne on account(s) different of the account(s)
       held by the Ordering Customer.
       
       - Several debit accounts, execution dates and currencies may be
       specified.
       
       - The Ordered Bank may need a confirmation/authorization (e.g.
       AUTHOR message) to be allowed to process the Multiple Payment Order
       message.
       
       - The only way to modify a Multiple Payment Order message is to
       cancel the whole message or part thereof (e.g. by the use of the
       FINCAN message). In that respect, one to many order(s) could be
       cancelled within the message, avoiding to be obliged to cancel the
       whole message.

       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles applying to the message are
       intended to facilitate the understanding of the message: 
       
       The Multiple Payment Order message is structured in three levels:
       
       A,B, and C. In the Branching Diagram, level A corresponds to page 1,
       level B corresponds to page 2, and level C corresponds to pages 
       3 and 4.
       
       -A level contains data related to the whole message and is contained
       in Segment Group 1 and Segment Group 2 and the Heading section.
       
       -B level contains data from the debit side (one debit account, one
       currency, one execution date) and data which applies to all further
       details of C level(s) and is contained in Segment Group 3 through
       Segment Group 9.
       
       -C level contains mainly data related to the credit side, and this
       data is considered as unique for each payment transaction and is
       contained in Segment Group 10 through Segment Group 21.
       
       - The structure of the message is designed to allow several B
       levels, each B level being followed by its related C levels.
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
