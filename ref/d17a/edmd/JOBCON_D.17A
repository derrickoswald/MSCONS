0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job order
       confirmation message (JOBCON) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The message intent is to confirm the receipt of information of a Job
       Order Message related to a vacancy or vacancies. The message is
       transmitted from an employment agency to an employer. The
       information is related to age, sex, profession, salaries,
       experiences, education, work and contract conditions.

1.2    Field of application

       The Job order confirmation message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is the confirmation by the employment
       agency of the detailed information for one or more jobs or vacancies
       offered by an employer. A Job Order Confirmation Message is
       transmitted from the employment agency to an employer. A Job Order
       Confirmation Message may contain detailed information about the
       requirements of an applicant for the job, e.g. age, sex, occupation
       or occupation type, location of the job, education, knowledge,
       experiences. A Job Order Confirmation Message may also contain
       detailed information of the salary offered, a job application and/or
       arrangements for an interview.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message: 
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd' or
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that
       there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. 
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months,
       etc.) 
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible. Conditional data that is not required in
       the message should not be included. 
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.

4.1.1  Header section


       Information to be provided in the Header section:

00010   UNH, Message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Job order confirmation message is JOBCON.

        must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

        Data element  0065 JOBCON
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A
                      0051 UN

00020   BGM, Beginning of message
        A segment which the sender must uniquely identify the job order

00030   DTM, Date/time/period
        A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
        related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at
        least once to identify the document date. The Date/time/period

           specified, e.g. where the enterprise and the job administration
           are known to each other, thus only the coded identification is
           required, but a job center or a job application address
           (interview) may vary and would have to be clearly specified,
           preferably in structured format.
