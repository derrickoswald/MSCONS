0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Order status
       enquiry message (OSTENQ) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message between a buyer or buyer's agent and a seller or seller's
       agent for information on the current status of a previously sent
       order(s).

1.2    Field of application

       The Order status enquiry message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may relate to:
       
       - one type of enquiry
       
       - one or more orders
       
       - specific lines within orders
       
       The order status enquiry can be sent as 'non-specific enquiries',
       i.e. asking for all outstanding orders, or as 'specific enquiries',
       i.e. asking for specific orders or order lines.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       - All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing
       the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks,
       months, etc.)
       
       - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible. 
       
       - Data that is not necessary to meet the functional requirements of
       the message should not be included.
       
       - Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger
       segment.
       
       - Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
