0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Purchase order
       response message (ORDRSP) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from the seller to the buyer, responding to a purchase
       order message or a purchase order change request message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Purchase order response message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A seller may respond for one or more goods items or services.
       
       - The response may be for a Purchase order or a Purchase order
       change request: 
       
       - an acknowledgment of receipt and understanding of data, 
       
       - confirmation of acceptance, 
       
       - a proposal of amendment, 
       
       - a notification of non-acceptance for all or part of the message.
       
       - A purchase order response may refer to goods items or services
       related to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.
       
       - A purchase order response for cross-border transactions may
       contain additional information for customs and/or statistical
       purposes.
       
       - A purchase order response may contain details for transport and
       destination as well as delivery patterns.
       
       - A buyer's purchase order may be responded to by one or more
       response messages, according to business practice.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       For guidance, the following principles serve to remove ambiguity in
       the application of an EDI Purchase Order Response
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section


       Information to be provided in the Header section:

00010   UNH, Message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Purchase order response message is
        ORDRSP.

        Note: Purchase order response messages conforming to this document
        must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

        Data element  0065 ORDRSP
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A
                      0051 UN

00020   BGM, Beginning of message
        A segment by which the sender must uniquely identify the order
        response by means of its number and when necessary its function.
        
        - If the MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE is a "12", "27" or "29" indicating
        that the total message was not processed, rejected or accepted. No
        segments, other than mandatory segments, need be used in the
        message Header, Detail or Summary sections. However for positive
        reporting purposes all the segments of the ORDERS or ORDCHG
        message, being responded to, may be used in ORDRSP.
        
        - If the MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE is a "28" indicating an accepted
        ORDERS or ORDCHG message with amended heading information or "34"
        indicating amendment in the message, then all segments in the
        heading section must be used from the ORDRES or ORDCHG message
        being responded to. This includes both amended and non amended
        segments.
        
        If the ORDERS message was "NOT PROCESSED"; use of MESSAGE FUNCTION
        CODE "12" indicates acknowledgement that the transmitted message
        has been received and understood by the seller, but remains to be
        processed within his application system.
        
        If the Order or Order Change message was "NOT ACCEPTED"; use of
        MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE "27" indicates that the seller declines to
        supply the goods or declines to accept the changes requested in a
        Purchase Order Change Request.
        
        If the ORDER or ORDER CHANGE message was "ACCEPTED, WITH AMENDMENT
        IN HEADING SECTION"; use of MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE "28" indicates
        that the seller accepts to supply the goods or services requested
        in the Purchase Order (or a Purchase Order Change Request), but
        requires one or more changes to the terms set out in the referenced
        message Heading Section.
        The complete Heading Section data is transmitted to replace all
        data previously sent. The Detail Section is considered as
        acknowledged without change.
        
        If the ORDER or ORDER CHANGE message was "ACCEPTED, WITHOUT
        AMENDMENT"; use of MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE "29" indicates that the
        seller according to the terms set out in the Purchase Order or a
        Purchase Order Change Request accepts to supply the goods or
        services requested or where appropriate accepts the cancellation.
        
        If the ORDER or ORDER CHANGE message was "ACCEPTED, WITH AMENDMENT
        IN DETAIL SECTION"; use of MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE "30" indicates
        that the seller accepts to supply the goods or services requested
        in the Purchase Order 
        (or a Purchase Order Change Request), but requires changes in one
        or more line items (as indicated in the LIN segments). The Heading
        Section is considered as acknowledged without change If the ORDER
        or ORDER CHANGE message was "ACCEPTED WITH AMENDMENT"; use of
        MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE "34" indicates that the seller accepts to
        supply the goods or services requested in the Purchase Order and
        Purchase Order Change Request, but requires changes in the Heading
        as well as Detail Section.

00030   DTM, Date/time/period
        A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
        related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at
        least once to identify the order response date.
        
        Examples of the use of this DTM segment are: Lead times that apply
        to the whole of the Order response and, if no schedule is to be
        specified, the delivery date.
        
        The Date/time/period segment within other Segment groups should be
        used whenever the date/time/period needs to be logically related to
        another specified data item. e.g. Payment due date is specified
        within the PYT Segment group.

00040   PAI, Payment instructions
        A segment requesting or confirming conditions of payment, guarantee
        and method of payment for the whole order response An example of
        the use of this segment is to specify that a documentary credit
        will be used.

00050   ALI, Additional information
        A segment indicating special conditions related to the total order
        response owing to origin, customs preference, or other commercial
        factors.

        A segment providing a description common to all line items of the
        order response.

00070   FTX, Free text
        A segment with free text information, in coded or clear form, used
        when additional information is needed but cannot be accommodated
        within other segments. In computer to computer exchanges such text
        will normally require the receiver to process this segment
        manually.

        A segment providing related identification numbers common to all
        line items.

           coded or clear form, and their functions relevant to the order
           response. Identification of the seller and buyer parties is
           mandatory for the order response message. It is recommended that
           where possible only the coded form of the party ID should be
           specified. e.g. The Buyer and Seller are known to each other,
           thus only the coded ID is required, but the Consignee or
           Delivery address may vary and would have to be clearly

           financial institutions for direct debit purposes.


00190      Segment group 4:  RFF-DTM
