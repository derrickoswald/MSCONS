0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Pricing history
       message (PRIHIS) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message furnishing the Pricing History and related information of
       goods previously ordered under conditions agreed to between a seller
       and a buyer.

1.2    Field of application

       The Pricing history message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Pricing history and related information may be furnished for one or
       more goods items.
       
       Typically, the detailed pricing history of an item will contain the
       item description, the quantity ordered, unit price paid, and related
       information.  
       
       Any individual set of pricing history data may contain more or less
       data depending on the nature of the historical file, nature of the
       previous purchases if any, and the needs of the party to whom the
       data will be transmitted.
