0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Balance of payment
       customer transaction report message (BOPCUS) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved
       in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Balance of payments customer transaction report message (BOPCUS)
       is sent by banks to the Balance of payments (BOP) compiler for
       reporting individual customer transactions (debit and credit)
       processed during a specific time period.

1.2    Field of application

       The Balance of payment customer transaction report message may be
       used for both national and international applications. It is based
       on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The structure of the BOPCUS message is related to the structure of
       the finance messages (PAYORD / PAYMUL / PAYEXT).
       
       The BOPCUS message can also be used to provide a copy of the
       relevant contents of a corresponding BOPINF or CREADV message.
