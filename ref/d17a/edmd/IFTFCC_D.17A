General Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the International
       transport freight costs and other charges message (IFTFCC) to be
       used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying freight, handling and transport costs and other
       related charges between transport service providers and their
       customers.

1.2    Field of application

       The International transport freight costs and other charges message
       may be used for both national and international applications. It is
       based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message will enable the parties involved in transport operations
       to indicate the various charges and costs. The structure of this
       information will enable parties to relate the charges and freight
       costs information received to the original instruction given by
       other transport messages (e.g. IFTMCS) to allow a one-by-one
       verification of the statement of charges.
       
       - The message is based on the applicable version of the UN/ECE
       Recommendation No. 23: Freight Cost Code - FCC, Harmonization of the
       description of freight costs and other charges.
       
       - Freight costs and or other charges may be related to: a single
       consignment, a number of consignments and or a number of equipment
       (periodical or consolidated charging), goods items and or a voyage
       conveyance flight of a means of transport.
       
       - Negative totals can be specified when credit notes and refunds
       form part of the charge handling.
       
       - Four main segment groups on message level follow after the PYT
       segment group, respectively:
       1) TDT segment group (segment group 17): transport details
       2) GID segment group (segment group 19): goods item details
       3) EQD segment group (segment group 24): equipment details
       4) CNI segment group (segment group 28): consignment details
       Each segment group may specify details to which the given charges
       relate.
       
       - Full details for a charge are specified in the TCC segment group
       on message top level. Single TCC segments occur on the lower levels
       of the message. These single TCC segments can be used, wherever
       appropriate, as pointers to full charge details which are given in
       the TCC segment group on message top level. When the TCC segment is
       used as a pointer then only the data element 'Freight and charges
       item number' (in composite C200) is to be used.
       
       - The annex includes a number of stylized examples, showing the
       basic outlines of how the message can be applied.
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a
       single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and or on-carriage (destination
       haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or
       instruction may take place in different steps, when each step is
       specified with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.

00350         CUX, Currencies
              A segment to indicate the currency in which the price is

           calculation within one occurrence of this MOA-group is placed in
           another occurrence of this MOA-group, which in turn may form the
           basis for an additional calculation.

              A segment to specify an amount related to a charge, such as:
              -   intermediate amount (such as in a pre-defined sequence)

                 can be re-calculated, such as:
                 -   from charge currency (i.e. currency in which the
                 charge applies) into reference currency (i.e. currency in
                 which freight is payable)
                 -   from reference currency into invoice currency (i.e.
