0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Despatch advice
       message (DESADV) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the United Nations Standard
       Despatch Advice message to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying details for goods despatched or ready for
       despatch under agreed conditions.
       
       The United Nations Despatch Advice Message serves both as a
       specification for Delivery Despatch Advice and also as a Returns
       Despatch Advice message. Throughout this document, the reference to
       'Despatch Advice' may be interpreted as conveying the wider meaning
       of 'Delivery Despatch Advice/Returns Despatch Advice'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Despatch advice message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message intent is to advise of the detailed contents of a
       consignment.
       
       The message relates to one seller and one buyer or their respective
       agents.
       
       The message relates to a single despatch point and single or
       multiple destination points. It may cover a number of different
       items or packages.
       
       It allows the recipient to:
       
        - know when the material has been despatched or will be ready for
       despatch
       
        - have the precise details of the consignment 
        
        - take initial steps towards Customs clearance in the case of
       international consignments
       
       - enable matching between despatched goods and the following
       invoice.

       Section 1.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should be
       omitted.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment
       of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.
