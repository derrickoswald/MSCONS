General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Banking status
       message (BANSTA) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A BANSTA message is sent by a financial institution to its customer
       and/or vice versa and among financial institutions. It is used for
       all kind of enquiries, answers and status information at application
       level.

1.2    Field of application

       The Banking status message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A BANSTA message must always refer to a specific previously-sent
       message.
       
       - A BANSTA message may cover the response given to any previously-
       sent message, such as a commercial or payment instruction, a request
       for information, etc. This message provides a means to report on
       errors and inconsistencies found in the original message at
       application level.
       
       - It is not intended to report on syntactical errors or to provide a
       non-repudiation response.
       
       - This message may provide status information about execution on
       original multi-instruction messages such as the Multiple Payment
       Order message (PAYMUL) or a multiple Direct Debit message in a
       positive and/or negative way.
       
       - This message does not apply to responses given to payment
       instructions, when another message type is necessary. This message
       could be used for any response to a previously-sent message when
       such response is needed and/or requested.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles apply to the message and are
       intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the
       message:
       
       The Banking Status message is structured in three levels: A, B and
       C.
       
       -   Level A Segment Groups 1, 2, 3 and 9 contains general data
       related to the whole message.
       
       -   Level B Segment Groups 4 and 5 refers to the previously-sent
       message and, if necessary, identifies a single transaction within a
       multiple message.
       
       -   Level C Segment Groups 6 to 8 provides the reason and details
       for the status of message/transaction.
       
       -   The structure of the message is designed to allow several B and
       C levels, each level B being followed by at least one or several C
       levels.
       
       -   Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
