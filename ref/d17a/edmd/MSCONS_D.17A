0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Metered services
       consumption report message (MSCONS) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A metered services consumption report is a communication between
       trading parties, or their agents, providing consumption and where
       associated technical, information at a location(s) for a product(s)
       or service(s) where the supply is recorded using a meter(s).

1.2    Field of application

       The Metered services consumption report message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - At least one delivery party (premise) shall be identified per
       message.
       
       - Each metered services consumption report will define the period of
       time for which the details contained are valid.
       
       - A metered services consumption report may be used to provide
       consumption information which may directly relate to other business
       functions, e.g. invoicing or process control.
       
       - A metered services consumption report may be sent by the buyer or
       the seller to the other party.
       
       - Metered services consumption report will be provided for premises
       as defined by trading partners.
       
       - Locations, products and, or services, and meters shall be
       identified where ever possible within the report using codes to
       facilitate automatic processing.
       
       - The metered services consumption report may be transmitted at any
       time and may be related directly to either a delivery(ies) and, or
       an invoice(s).
       
       - A metered services consumption report when used to support the
       financial information contained in an invoice may only relate to one
       invoice.
       
       - A metered services consumption report when used to indicate
       consumption or qualitative information may relate to one or many
       delivery parties (premises).

       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       - Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       - Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger
       segment of a group.
       
       - Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when additional
       information that cannot be accommodated within the other segments is
       required.
