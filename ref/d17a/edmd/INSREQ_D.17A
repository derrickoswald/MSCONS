0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Inspection request
       message (INSREQ) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message sent by a supplier to inform a customer that items are
       ready for inspection prior to despatch.

1.2    Field of application

       The Inspection request message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       An Inspection request message is sent by a supplier to a customer's
       inspection service, or a third party who is acting on his behalf
       indicating that items are ready for inspection. The inspection
       process is generally to ensure that the articles are in compliance
       with a base document such as a purchase order.
