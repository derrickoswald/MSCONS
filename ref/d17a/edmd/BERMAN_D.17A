General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Berth management
       message (BERMAN) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Berth management message is a message from a carrier, its agent
       or means of transport to the authority responsible for port and
       waterway management, requesting a berth, giving details of the call,
       vessel, berth requirements and expected operations.

1.2    Field of application

       The Berth management message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message is meant to comply with requirements of authorities
       concerning the request for berthing services. The following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Berth management
       message:
       
       1- A message will contain information on only one means of
       transport/conveyance. The only exception will be the case of
       covering pre-announcement function.
       
       2- A ship call may require several berths.
       
       3- One berth may be the scenario of several operations.
       
       4- The message has to cater for the provision of sending updates
       (cancellation, replace, provisional, definitive) or new services
       request such as shifts and request for second berth. The message
       will cover the function of pre-announcement of vessels.
       
       The Transport SWG Working Group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
