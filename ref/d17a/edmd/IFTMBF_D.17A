0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Firm booking
       message (IFTMBF) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Firm Booking Message to be
       used in fulfilling the requirements of trading partners in the
       transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of cargo and transport
       related information using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
       
       This message is a single consignment based message, being aligned
       with other single consignment based messages such as the other two
       booking messages (IFTMBP and IFTMBC), the instruction messages
       (IFTMIN and IFTMCS) and the Arrival Notice Message (IFTMAN).
       The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes of
       transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any origin
       to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial
       practice.
       These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the transport of
       goods between all parties to the movement of the consignment
       (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the
       forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as providing the
       information necessary to perform that transport and delivery of the
       goods.
       
       They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport when
       the requirements are common even if functionally similar information
       is known by different names.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from a party definitely booking forwarding and/or
       transport services for a consignment to the party providing those
       services. The message will contain the conditions under which the
       sender of the messages requires the services to take place.

1.2    Field of application

       The Firm booking message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Firm Booking Message will be sent, usually after an initial space
       booking has been made. This means that a Firm Booking Message could
       be sent as the initial message.
       
       The message must be seen as a commitment from the shipper to the
       carrier or forwarder to execute certain services and is used for
       operational purposes by the service provider.
       
       A booking-firm can be answered by a confirmation in any form by the
       service provider but this is not obligatory.
       
       A booking firm message can be updated/replaced by a new booking firm
       message. It contains all relevant data elements of a consignment for
       operational purposes and is followed by an Instruction to ascertain
       a contract.
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a
       single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in
       one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order
       transport for one or more goods items.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or issue
       instructions of transport to be arranged for several goods items by
       means of one or several of the following messages: IFTMBP, IFTMBF,
       IFTMBC, IFTMIN, IFTMCS, IFTMAN.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination
       haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or
       instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified
       with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a
       temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on
       another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to
       or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a
       container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on
       their own, are specified in the transport details group. Other load
       or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up
       to three levels.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.

       * TYPE OF EQUIPMENT: The type of material used, e.g. 40 feet
