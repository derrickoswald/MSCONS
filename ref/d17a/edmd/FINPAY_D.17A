0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Multiple interbank
       funds transfer message (FINPAY) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Multiple interbank funds transfer message is sent between
       financial institutions to request the transfer of funds in
       settlement of the referenced business transaction(s).
       
       The FINPAY message may be exchanged directly between financial
       institutions or through a clearing system.
       
       Depending on the account relationship between the financial
       institutions, the FINPAY may be used as a payment order and/or as a
       credit advice.
       
       The FINPAY may also be used for collections, documentary credits,
       direct debits and other financial institution related transfers.

1.2    Field of application

       The Multiple interbank funds transfer message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Multiple interbank funds transfer message may cover several
       funds transfer instructions.
       
       - However, one FINPAY message must cover either credit transfers or
       debit transfers, i.e., these two functions must not be mixed in the
       same message.
       
       - The only way to modify a Multiple interbank funds transfer message
       is to cancel the whole message or part thereof (e.g., by using the
       FINCAN - Financial Cancellation message). In that respect, one to
       many transaction(s) could be cancelled within the message, avoiding
       the need to cancel the whole message.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles applying to the message are
       intended to facilitate the understanding of the message:
       
       The Multiple interbank funds transfer message is structured in three
       levels: A, B, and C.
       
       - Level A contains general data related to the whole message and is
       contained in Segment Groups 1, 2, 31 and 32.
       
       - Level B contains information needed to effect the funds transfer,
       such as the total amount to be transferred, the value date, the
       currency, the charges allocation, and data which applies to all the
       dependent C levels and is contained in Segment Group 3 through
       Segment Group 11.
       
       - Level C contains data specific to the individual transactions and
       may contain remittance information. This data is considered as
       unique for each transaction and is contained in Segment Group 12
       through Segment Group 30.
       
       The structure of the message is designed to allow several B levels,
       each B level being followed by its related C levels.
