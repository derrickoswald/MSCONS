0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Health care claim
       or encounter request and response - interactive message (IHCLME) to
       be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading
       partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message is to support interactive submittal and response of
       health care claims or encounters for the point of sale environment.
       It will be used in health care information scenarios when immediate
       response is appropriate.

1.2    Field of application

       The Health care claim or encounter request and response -
       interactive message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message establishes the data contents of the IHCLME. 
       This can be used to create interactive communications between health
       care providers (e.g., physicians, hospitals, other medical
       facilities, dentists, etc.), health care information processors,
       health care payers, and/or their agents. The information includes,
       but is not limited to, billing information (for full or partial
       adjudication), encounter reporting, additional service information
       (denial reasons, errors, pending data, etc.), and coordination of
       benefits.
       
       IHCLME may be used for the following functions within the claim or
       encounter scenario for health care:
       
       (1) To request and respond to a request for processing a claim or
       encounter episode.
       (2) To request and respond to a request to modify or cancel a
       previously submitted claim or encounter.
       (3) To request and respond to a pre-determination of benefits as it
       relates to a covered life.
       (4) To request and respond to a need for additional information as
       it relates to a claim or encounter episode.
       
       An example of health care processors or their agents includes:
       
       - Insurance Companies
       - Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)
       - Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs)
       - Health Care Purchasers (e.g., employers)
       - Professional Review Organizations (PROs)
       - Social Worker Organizations
       - Health Care Providers (e.g., physicians, hospitals, laboratories)
       - Third Party Administrators (TPAs)
       - Health Care Vendors (e.g., practice management vendors, billing
       services)
       - Service Bureaus (value added networks or value added banks)
       - Government agencies such as Medicare, Medicaid and Civilian 
       Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services 
       (CHAMPUS).

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.

00010   UIH, Interactive message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Health care claim or encounter request
        and response - interactive message is IHCLME.

        Note: Health care claim or encounter request and response -
        interactive messages conforming to this document must contain the
        following data in segment UIH, composite S306:

        Data element  0065 IHCLME
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A
                      0051 UN

00020   MSD, Message action details
        To specify the message processing requirements, response type, and
        to provide a tracking mechanism. The reference number in this
        segment will provide for a different tracking number than what is
        generated in the message envelope, for application level tracking.

00030   PRT, Party information
        To provide specific identification numbers and demographic 
        information regarding the identity of the participating parties.
        Date of birth, eligibility date, and date of death may be specified
        as well as relationship between the patient and the insured, sex,
        employment category, marital status, student status, and a yes or
        no indication of whether the patient is pregnant.

00040   NAA, Name and address
        To specify a party identity, and, when necessary, the name and/or
        the address in either a structured or unstructured format. For use
        in health care, it is recommended to use only the identification,
        but if the name or address are needed, to use only the structured
        method of submittal.

00050   CON, Contact information
        To provide electronic message routing information for additional
        recipients of this message. The reference number will provide  a
        unique reference number to be used by the contact entity when
        referring to this message.

00060   BLI, Billable information
        To provide summarized information about all services covered under 
        one health care claim or encounter. This segment allows detail
        relating to monetary amounts for the total amount being charged for
        the claim, total amount that the patient has paid, and the total
        amount paid by other benefit carriers. Multiple diagnoses that
        apply to the entire claim, and multiple dates may be conveyed. The
        plan sponsor can receive the reference of any pre-authorization
        information associated with the claim and through a series of yes
        and no indications will know whether the provider accepts the
        insurance payment as payment in full, and whether the patient has
        signed documents releasing the medical information to the insurance
        carrier and authorizing the payment directly to the provider. The
        presence, nature, date, and state or province of a cause related to
        this claim, such as an accident, may also be indicated.

00070   ITC, Institutional claim
        To provide specific claim information only needed when processing
        claims for services performed while admitted to a health care
        institution. When the claim is generated from a health care 
        institution, additional information such as the type (e.g. first,
        intermediate, last) and frequency of invoicing during an extended
        admission, the number of days covered and non covered by insurance,
        the type (e.g. emergency, scheduled) and source of admission, the
        discharge type (e.g. ambulatory, transfer, dead), and information
        about other products and services related to the institutional
        admission may be needed.

00080   ADI, Health care claim adjudication information
        To provide adjudication information for all services, supplies or
        products in the health care claim. The internal control number
        assigned by the payer, the specific service trace or sequence
        number  designated for this service in the original claim, the
        payment or  draft control number, the health care service being
        paid, the health case service originally billed, the health care
        service institutional "revenue" code, the notification of the
        adjudication action taken by the payer, the total amount paid,
        other informational amounts (e.g negotiated discount), the number
        of services adjudicated, the number  of services originally billed,
        the importance given to the diagnosis related group in calculating
        the payment, the financial adjustments (e.g. deductible, agreed fee
        limit) made in the adjudication,  identification of health care
        policy limitations, the insurance product group (e.g. indemnity,
        managed care, federal program), the anticipated date of payment,
        the diagnosis category from a diagnosis related grouping program,
        and the percentage known as "discharge fraction" may all be sent in
        this segment.

00090   FRM, Follow-up action
        To identify specific corrective actions that should occur before
        the adjudication process can complete. The identity number in this
        segment must be one of the identity number given in an ADI segment.
        The follow-up actions may be for the entire claim or may be service
        specific.


00100   Segment group 1:  OTI-NAA
        A group of segments to identify all parties by code and name  that
        may provide insurance coverage for the patient being treated.

00110      OTI, Other insurance
           To provide payer, insured and payment information when benefits 
           are being coordinated between third party benefit carriers. A
           major source of concern in health care is being able to
           coordinate benefits between multiple insurance carriers. This
           segment will be used to reference other payers that may need to
           be kept abreast of the health care transaction and what monetary
           amounts are being paid by the respective carrier. Even though
           three different carriers may be identified, there is a yes or no
           indicator that will allow the indication of additional carriers
           beyond what is being sent.

00120      NAA, Name and address
           To specify identification numbers, name and address information
           relating to the other insurance parties. If available, the 
           identification number of the insurance carrier should be used.
           When the identification number is not available, or the
           insurance carrier operates out of multiple offices, the name
           and/or address should be used.


00130   Segment group 2:  PSI-DNT
        To identify the specific service information for the claim or
        encounter.

00140      PSI, Service information
           To provide detail information about the service, product, or
           procedure. This segment allows the payer of a health care
           transaction to indicate line item detail about all services
           performed. All charges can be broken down, several of the
           diagnosis codes from the claim can be references with an index
           identifier, and any supporting evidence and out of band
           additional information needed for the claim can be referenced.

00150      DNT, Dental information
           To provide specific a complete description of each tooth in
           relation to the service. Only in a dental claim, would the payer
           need to know specific tooth and additional information on the
           surface, gum depth or status.

00160   UIT, Interactive message trailer
        A service segment ending a message, giving the total number of
        segments in the message (including the UIH & UIT) and the control
        reference number of the message.
