0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Interactive health
       insurance eligibility and benefits inquiry and response (IHCEBI) to
       be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading
       partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       The Interactive health insurance eligibility benefit inquiry and
       response message may be used for both national and international
       applications.  It is based on universal practices related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.
       
       In particular, IHCEBI can be applied to all types of health care
       service providers, funding institutions and health care delivery
       systems.

1.1    Functional definition

       The IHCEBI message is sent from institutional or individual health
       care providers or those providing related administrative services to
       a funding institution to obtain health insurance information from a
       patient’s health plan prior to or at the time of admission or
       treatment.
       
       This inquiry message will allow a health care provider to give their
       patient an estimate of cost for certain treatments, or assess their
       own financial risk associated with certain treatments, and provide
       the patient with informed financial choices regarding their health
       care options.
       
       Each inquiry can provide information to the health plan about a
       service being considered, (e.g., actual or expected service dates,
       actual or expected duration of hospital stay, and planned services).
        An inquiry can also contain information about the treating and
       referring practitioner, if they are not the health care party making
       the inquiry.
       
       The response message will provide information regarding what
       benefits are available to the patient based on their health plan
       contract and the information provided with the inquiry. This can
       include financial information, such as, co-pay amounts, deductible
       amounts, limitations, and exclusions.
       
       Each response can also provide information regarding administrative
       issues concerning a covered benefit, such as, indicate who is the
       primary provider for a service, contact information for the health
       plan and patient, and policy rules, such as, certain screening exams
       can only be done once every two years.

1.2    Field of application

       The Interactive health insurance eligibility and benefits inquiry
       and response may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The IHCEBI message can carry either an initial inquiry,
       modifications to an inquiry made in a previous eligibility request
       and response message from the funding institution.
       
       An inquiry can only concern one patient or health plan subscriber,
       but may concern one or more services or procedures regarding an
       individual patient or subscriber.  A response is limited to
       providing an answer to the questions asked about a patient or health
       plan subscriber, but may report benefits for multiple family
       members.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

3.2    Message terms and definitions

       Capitated provider - is a term that describes a provider who is
       under contract with a health plan and the provider agrees to receive
       a monthly capitation payment amount per patient each month in lieu
       of fee for service payment or charges.  Under this arrangement a
       provider cannot charge for services rendered that are described in
       their contract, for example, routine well visits or sick visits.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.

00010   UIH, Interactive message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Interactive health insurance eligibility
        and benefits inquiry and response is IHCEBI.

        Note: Interactive health insurance eligibility and benefits inquiry
        and responses conforming to this document must contain the
        following data in segment UIH, composite S306:

        Data element  0065 IHCEBI
                      0052 D
                      0054 17A
                      0051 UN

00020   MSD, Message action details
        Use to specify the message and processing requirements, for
        example, the type of health care insurance verification to be done
        and to provide a tracking mechanism for the submitter of 
        the message.  The reference number in this segment will provide an
        application level tracking number, which is different from what is
        generated in the message envelope.


00030   Segment group 1:  PRT-NAA-CON-FRM
        Associated Parties Group:
        A group of segments that will be repeated once for each party
        involved with this eligibility message, used to identify and
        provide information about each party by code and name.  Parties may
        include and a loop would be present for: 
        1) Submitter - when serving as an agent for the provider,
        2) Requester - either a provider, payer, or employer making a
        request,
        3) Responder - either a payer or a third party administrator when
        serving as an agent for the payer,
        4) Subscriber - will always be present, and
        5) Patient - present only when patient is not the subscriber.
        
        In the response message the responder may optionally add one or
        more entries to this loop to identify a patient's primary care
        physician (PCP)  or specialist, if the provider making the inquiry
        is not the patient's PCP or specialist.  Other parties may also be
        added to identify other capitated providers associated with the
        patient care and health plan.

00040      PRT, Party information
           To provide specific entity identifiers or demographic
           information regarding the identity of the participating parties.
            For individuals identifiers will include date of birth, or a
           health plan insurance card date of issue as shown on the card
           may be specified in this segment, when the segment is
           identifying a health plan subscriber.

00050      NAA, Name and address
           Use to specify a party identity, and when necessary, the name
           and address of an entity and their related function in either a
           structured or unstructured format.  For use in health care, it
           is recommended to use only the name and identifier, but when
           name and address are required use only the structured method of
           submittal.  This segment is providing the name and address of
           the party identified in the Associated Parties Group.

00060      CON, Contact information
           Use to specify contact communication numbers, names, and
           electronic message routing information.  Use to provide
           information about contacts within an organization or associated
           with the party identified in the Associated Parties Loop who can
           be called upon for further or clarifying information.  The
           reference number may be used to provide a unique number for the
           contact entity to use when referring to this message.

00070      FRM, Follow-up action
           Used only with the response message, this will identify specific
           corrective actions or follow-up that should occur before another
           inquiry is made about this entity.  Errors reported here related
           to the parties identified in the Associated Parties Group.  For
           example, provider is not authorised to inquire against this
           payer's files.


00080   Segment group 2:  DTI-ICI-FRM-SG3
        Global Benefit Service Details Group:
        This group of segments will occur only once for an eligibility
        request or response.  It provides coverage or service information
        that is common for each health insurance benefit and service
        coverage reported.

00090      DTI, Date and time information
           Use to specify dates that will common to each benefit or covered
           service.

           service or planned service dates for the benefits in question.
           
           On the response message, this segment will specify the effective
           dates of benefit coverage for all listed benefits.  The
           information in this segment can be overridden for a specific
           benefit, when effective or termination dates are different from
           the overall plan.  This is done in the Health Insurance Benefit
           Details Group for each reported benefit where it applies.

00100      ICI, Insurance cover information
           Use to specify a type of insurance, this will apply to all
           information that follows.

00110      FRM, Follow-up action
           To identify specific corrective actions or follow-up that should
           occur before another inquiry is made about the patient in the
           request message.  This segment is only sent with the response
           message when there are errors to report related to the benefit
           information request message within the Global Benefit and
           Service Coverage Group.  For example, an invalid service date or
           insurance type was specified.


00120      Segment group 3:  BCD-HDS-DTI-PRT-FRM
           Health Insurance Benefit Details Group:
           This segment group provides health insurance coverage and
           benefit information about a particular person’s health insurance
           plan.  This segment group can be repeated to describe each
           benefit or covered service in question.  Each benefit or covered
           service will require a separate repetition.
           
           When this message is sent as a request for health insurance
           available benefits and coverage, it will specify the type of
           health benefit information that is required.
           
           When this message is sent in response to a request, this segment
           group will provide the requested health insurance coverage and
           benefit information as requested by the inquiry.

00130         BCD, Benefit and coverage detail
              Use to specify specific benefits and associated coverage.
              
              When used on the request message, it will specify a specific
              benefit or covered service in question.
              
              When used on the response, it will provide information about
              the requested health insurance benefits and coverage
              available, plus any additional administrative information
              that may have a business or patient care impact to the party
              making the inquiry.

00140         HDS, Health diagnosis service and delivery
              Use to specify diagnosis information and procedure or therapy
              services and details about how and when these services can be
              delivered, based on the diagnosis or procedure or contract
              terms or all of these.
              
              When this information is sent on the request, it is
              describing the diagnosis of the patient and asking about
              benefit coverage for a specific procedure or therapy.
              
              When the information is sent on the response, it is providing
              information from the health insurance plan about what benefit
              coverage is available, for certain procedures based on the
              diagnosis and what service delivery requirements exist, which
              can vary based on diagnosis, procedure, and health plan
              contract.

00150         DTI, Date and time information
              Use to specify eligibility dates related to the benefit or
              service described in the current iteration of the Health
              Insurance Benefit Details Group.
              
              When used at this level on the request message, it is to
              specify service dates from the provider that are outside of
              the service dates specified in the Global Benefit Service
              Details Group.
              
              When used at this level on the response message it identifies
              eligibility start or termination dates assigned by the
              responder that override the overall eligibility dates
              identified in the earlier Global Benefit Service Details
              Group.

00160         PRT, Party information
              Use to reference a specific payer or provider for the benefit
              or service identified in the current Health Insurance Benefit
              Details Group.  The payer or provider should be in the list
              of parties identified within the Associated Parties Group,
              where full details of the entity should be provided,
              including name, address, and contact information.  The payer
              is most likely used for third party liability for
              coordination of benefits.  Identified providers would be
              those restricted to providing services for the identified
              benefit, for example, a capitated provider.

00170         FRM, Follow-up action
              Use to identify specific corrective actions or follow-up that
              should occur before another inquiry is made about this
              subject entity, that is, the patient or health plan
              subscriber.  Errors reported at this level of the message are
              benefit specific, reporting processing errors from the
              responding application associated with the benefit inquiry
              request.

00180   UIT, Interactive message trailer
