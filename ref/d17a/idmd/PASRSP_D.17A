0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Travel, tourism

       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Travel, tourism and leisure product application status response
       message is sent in response to a product application status request
       message to tell a service supplier that requests should or should
       not be sent for an application or product.

1.2    Field of application

       The Travel, tourism and leisure product application status response
       - interactive message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       PASRSP may be used for the following functions that facilitate the
       operation of the interactive scenario for travel, tourism and
       leisure:
       
       (1) to respond to a request asking if an application, such as a
       message type, scenario, or dialogue type is available for requests.
       
       (2) to respond to a message from a supplier that specifies when
       request messages will not be received because of file maintenance.
       
       (3) to respond to a message from a supplier to indicate if the
       travel reservation system supplier is ready to receive data base
       update messages and if not, a date and time that the messages can be
       sent and the volume that can be sent.
