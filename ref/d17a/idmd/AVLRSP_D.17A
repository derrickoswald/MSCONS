       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An interactive Travel, Tourism and Leisure Availability Response is
       sent by a service provider in response to an availability request
       for a Travel, Tourism and Leisure service. The Travel, Tourism and
       Leisure Availability Request - interactive (AVLREQ) is utilised to
       provide an interactive request for which the interactive
       availability response is used to respond.

1.2    Field of application

       The Availability response - interactive message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       AVLRSP may be used for the following functions within the
       Interactive Scenario for Travel, Tourism and Leisure:
       
       (1) to respond to a general availability request for any hotel,
       rental car, train trip, airline flight, or tour in a specific city
       or geographical region for a date or range of dates. The response
       may include products from multiple service providers and multiple
       classes of service, car types, room types as is appropriate to the
       product.
       
       (2) to respond to availability for one or more specific hotels,
       rental cars, train trips, airline flights, or tours for a specific
       date. Along with the availability, the response may include rates,
       rules, and specific information about the product.
       
       (3) to respond only with rules and rates for a specific product.
