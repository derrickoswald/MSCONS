
UN/EDIFACT STANDARD DIRECTORY

PART 1  INTRODUCTION

Presentation of the UN/EDIFACT Standard Directory.

0.   The UN/EDIFACT Standard is an electronic data interchange
     standard maintained by users under the auspices of the United
     Nations. The standard documents UN/EDIFACT messages and 
     supporting information, which are used for the exchange of
     business information between disparate information system, often
     in an inter-company environment. The use of electronic messaging 
     in this area has proven to be cost reducing. The wide deployment
     of UN/EDIFACT has enabled the users to further reduce cost
     through consolidation of investments and improved quality and 
     standardized representation business information in the messages.

1.   The UN/EDIFACT Standard Directory contains the documentation of
     UN/EDIFACT messages and their supporting directories (segment,
     composite data element, data element, and code documentation).
     It includes the approved UNSM specifications in the message type
     directories (EDMD, IDMD) and its supporting directories, the
     segments (EDSD, IDSD), the composite data elements (EDCD, IDCD),
     the data elements (EDED) and the code list (UNCL).

2.   The UN/EDIFACT Standard Directory is intended for both national
     and international electronic data interchange applications. The
     development work is undertaken by experts in the UN/EDIFACT
     Working Group (EWG), and the EWG is responsible for the
     registration and maintenance of UNSMs and their supporting
     material.

3.   As agreed by the UNECE, the syntax to be applied to messages
     based upon the UN/EDIFACT Standard Directory is the joint UN-ISO
     EDIFACT Syntax standard, published as ISO 9735. This standard is
     maintained by the Joint ISO/TC 154-UN/CEFACT Syntax Working Group
     (JSWG) which is comprised of a group of experts from ISO/TC 154
     and UN/CEFACT. ISO 9735 may be used in any application, but a
     message using the rules may be referred to as an UN/EDIFACT
     message only if it is a valid subset of the referenced UNSM.

     these directories. 

8.   Part 3 constitutes the UN/EDIFACT directory of messages,
     segments, composites, elements and codes. A short introduction to
     each of the files follows below. There are two sets of messages,
     one for batch use, and one for interactive use. While having the
     same basic design philosophy, the sets differ in the way they
     represent concepts. This is due to the fact that interactive
     messages have been developed for systems that require synchronous
     responses, while batch messaging is normally done asynchronously.
     For a full overview of the layout of the directory, please refer
     to Rules for Presentation of Standardized Message and Directories
     Documentation identified above.

 8.1 The following interdependent files together define the UN/EDIFACT
     Standard Directory.

  a. UNCL - UN/EDIFACT Consolidated Code List, a list of all code sets 
     associated with coded data elements. The UNCL is organized by
     data element, which is identified by its tag, name, description,
     representation and an indicator whether the element is used in
     batch, interactive or both directories, sorted by tag. The codes
     for each element are then described with value, name and
     description, sorted by value.
  b. EDED - UN/EDIFACT Data Elements Directory, a list of all data
     elements. The EDED is organized as a list of elements with tag,
     name, description, representation and an indicator whether the
     element is used in batch, interactive or both directories. Two 
     index files with just the tag, name and usage indicator are
     available as well, one ordered by tag, the other by name.

     For batch messages:

  c. EDCD - UN/EDIFACT Composite Data Elements Directory, with their 
     component data elements. The EDCD is organized as a list of
     composites with tag, name and description, sorted by tag. For
     each composite, the list of component data elements is given with
     position, tag, name, mandatory indicator and representation for
     each element in the structure. Two indexes with just the
     composite element tag and name are available as well, one sorted
     by tag, the other by name.
  d. EDSD - UN/EDIFACT Standard Segments Directory, which contains as
     full description of all standard segments used in UNSMs. The EDSD
     is organized as a list of segments with tag, name and function,
     sorted by tag. For each segment, the list of composite and
     standalone data elements is given with position, tag, name,
     mandatory indicator, cardinality and representation (for
     standalone elements) or substructure (for composites). Two
     indexes with just the segment tag and name are available as
     well, one sorted by tag, the other by name.
  e. EDMD - UN/EDIFACT Directory of UNSMs, which contains a full
     description of all United Nations Standard Message Types. The
     EDMD is organized as a set of files, one for each message, where
     the message is described by a general introduction (introduction/
     scope/references/terms and definitions), and the message
     definition. The message definition starts with the segment
     clarification which introduces each segment used in the message,
     as well as the segment groups used. The message structure gives a
     more graphical representation of the structure of the message. In
     addition to a file for each UNSM, the EDSD contains two indexes
     with the message code and name, one sorted by code, the other by
     name.

     For interactive messages:

  f. IDCD - UN/EDIFACT Interactive Composite Data Elements Directory, 
     with their component data elements. The IDCD is organized in the
     same way as the EDCD.
  g. IDSD - UN/EDIFACT Interactive Standard Segments Directory, which 
     contains a full description of all standard segments used in
     UNSMs. The IDSD is organized in the same way as the EDSD.
  h. IDMD - UN/EDIFACT Interactive Directory of UNSMs, which contains
     a full description of all United Nations Interactive Standard
     Message Types. The IDMD is organized in the same way as the EDMD.
