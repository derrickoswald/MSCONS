	or component data element is used optionally or when the appropriate 
	conditions occur.  [ISO 9735]

Data element: a unit of data described in a data element specification. There

	element having one or more of its occurrences (up to a maximum specified 
	number) present in a transfer; and where a null set of occurrences of a

Release:  starting in March 1997 values contained in service simple data element 
	[0054] shall be interpreted as a concatenated number reflecting both 
	version and release and shall uniquely identify any instance of a 
	published directory. Version shall be interpreted as the annual variant of 
	the published directory.  Release shall be interpreted as the sequence of 
	publication for multiple directories published within any annual variant. 
	The value for [0054] is represented by the year {YY} followed by a 
	sequential alpha character assigned by the UNECE. This sequential alpha 
	character begins with "A" at the start of each year and is incremented if 
	more than one directory is published during the same year, e.g. the letter 
	"A" for the first issue of the year or the letter "B" for the second issue 
	of the year.

Repeating data element: a composite data element or stand-alone data element

Repeating segment: a segment that may repeat in a message as
	specified in the relevant message type specification.

Requirement designator: see status.

Revision: an indicator of change appearing on the boilerplate cover page after 
	"Revision".  When applied to an UNSM, in any instance of a Standard 
	Directory the value indicates the number of times the UNSM has been 
	revised as of that particular point in time.  Upon initial approval of the 
	message as a UNSM, the value applied shall be 1 (one) and each subsequent 
	change to the message boilerplate or segment table shall result in the 
	incremental increase of this value by 1 (one). In the case of a recast 
	message, the number shall again be incremented by 1 (one) from its 
	previous value.  The number is automatically assigned during directory 
	production. When applied to a MID, the revision number is assigned by the 
	organization developing the MID and is a sequential number starting with 0 
	(zero) and incremented by 1 (one) with each change to the MID.

Segment: an identified, named and structured set of functionally related 
	composite data elements and/or stand-alone data elements, as described in 
	a segment specification; a segment starts with the segment tag and ends 
	with the segment terminator. In transfer, a segment is a specific ordered 
	set of one or more composite data element(s) and/or stand-alone data 
	element(s) in conformance with a segment specification and the syntax 
	rules for transfer. [ISO 9735]

	permits its differentiation from all other segments. Referred to as 
	'segment description' in document.

	specification [ISO 9735] See EDSD and IDSD.

Segment group: An identified hierarchical set of segments and/or segment groups 
	within a message. (ISO 9735)   

Segment qualifier: see qualifier.

	including the specification of the position, status, maximum number of 
	repetitions and any dependency notes of the data elements constituting the 
	segment. 

Segment table: a table showing the sequential order of segments,
	their arrangements in segment groups and the status and
	allowed repetitions of the segments and groups in a message.

Segment tag: 3 upper alphabetic characters string that uniquely identify a 
	segment in a segment directory 

Segment terminator: a service character indicating the end of a
	segment.  [ISO 9735] UN/EDIFACT: the default service character reserved for 
	use is the apostrophe.

Simple data element: a data element containing a single data element value. 
	There are two uses of a simple data element: within a composite data 
	element (component data element); and within a segment outside a composite 
	data element (stand-alone data element). [ISO 9735]

Simple element definition: A statement that describes the meaning of a simple 
	data element and permits the differentiation from all other simple data 
	elements. Referred to as 'data element description' in document.

Status: an attribute of a segment, a composite data element or a simple data 
	element identifying the rules for the presence or absence of the 
	segment/data element in the usage of a message. The types of status are 
	conditional and mandatory. [ISO 9735]

TDID: see UNTDID.

	Explanatory material. 

Version:  starting in March 1997, the version number identified within service 
	simple data element [0052] has the following interpretation: for MIDs, the 
	value for [0052] is "0" signifying that the message is a MID and is not 
	contained in the directory.  For UNSMs, the value for [0052] is "D" 
	signifying that the message is contained within the directory and is an 
	approved standard message.

Version/release: in directories published prior to March 1997, different 
	interpretations were given to the concept of version and release than the 
	concepts applied to current directories. For earlier directories, consult 
	the definitions applied within the service code lists for service simple 
	data elements [0052] and [0054]. For current interpretations, see 
	definitions included herein for version and for release.
