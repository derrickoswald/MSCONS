  0523  Use of algorithm, coded

  Desc: Specification of the usage made of the algorithm.

  Repr: an..3

   1      Owner hashing
             Specifies that the algorithm is used by the message
             sender to compute the hash function on the message (as in
             the case of Integrity or Non-repudiation of Origin
             identified in the security function qualifier of USH).
   2      Owner symmetric
             Specifies that the algorithm is used by the message
             sender either for integrity, confidentiality, or message
             origin authentication (specified by security service,
             coded in USH).
   3      Issuer signing
             Specifies that the algorithm is used by the Certificate
             Issuer (CA) to sign the hash result computed on the
             certificate.
   4      Issuer hashing
             Specifies that the algorithm is used by the Certificate
             Issuer (CA) to compute the hash result on the
             certificate.
   5      Owner enciphering
             Specifies that the algorithm is used by the message
             sender to encrypt a symmetric key.
   6      Owner signing
             Specifies that the algorithm is used by the message
             sender to sign either the hash result computed on the
             message or the symmetric keys.
   7      Owner enciphering or signing
             Specifies that the algorithm may be used by the message
             sender either to encrypt a symmetric key or sign the hash
             result computed on the  message. This value may only be
             used in a USA segment within a USC segment group. When
             encrypting a symmetric key a receiver certificate shall
             be used. When signing a hash result a sender certificate
             shall be used.
   8      Owner compressing
             Specifies that the algorithm is used by the message
             sender to compress the data before (encryption and)
             submission.
   9      Owner compression integrity
             Specifies that the algorithm is used by the message
             sender on the compressed data before (encryption and)
             submission. The integrity value is used to verify the
             contents of the compressed text before expansion.
   10     Key agreement
             Specifies that the algorithm is used by the initiator and
             responder to agree a secret key.

   1      Zero padding
             Message padding used for block cipher algorithms. Binary
             zeros are appended to the end of the message in order to
             make the message length an exact integer multiple of the
             block length. The block length is implicitly specified
             through the algorithm and mode of operation.
   2      PKCS #1 padding
